<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">Preface</span></h2>
<p>This book has been written for the layman who
has no knowledge about atoms, bombs and radioactivity. He
knows that the world is made of atoms, that bombs might
destroy it and that radioactivity could make it a place much
less agreeable to live in.</p>
<p>We should like to give some advice about the use of the
book: Each chapter can be read by itself. The chapters need
not be taken in the order in which they are printed. To read
them all will give a more complete understanding&mdash;and if
you have time it is best to read them in the order they are
arranged. Some of the earlier chapters perhaps overflow with
facts. In some later chapters we wish that more facts were
available. These latter the reader will probably understand
and remember quite easily. He may not agree with all of
their contents. On the other hand the more scientific chapters
(II to VIII) will not be questioned but may be harder to
read and to remember. It will be a help to keep this in mind:
No chapter <i>follows</i> from another but most chapters are related
and support some other part of the book.</p>
<p>Our knowledge about fallout is increasing rapidly. Some
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
questions which are raised in the book may already have been
answered. With this added knowledge we might have been
more quantitative in some of our statements. But we believe
the main conclusions would not be altered.</p>
<p>This book was completed before the Sputniks. In their
present form these have little to do with the subject of nuclear
energy. However, to our mind, the urgency has become
greater for the non-scientist to understand those parts of
science and technology which may affect his safety and well-being,
and the safety and well-being of his country. We hope
that this book will contribute in some measure to such
understanding.</p>

<br />The Need to Know</h2>
<p>Our world is changing, and the change is becoming
more rapid. The moving force behind this change
is scientific discovery. All of us are deeply affected by the
consequences of science. At the same time, very few understand
the highly technical foundations of our civilization.
In this situation it is natural that scientific and technical
progress should create uneasiness and alarm.</p>
<p>Fear of what we do not know or do not understand has
been with us in all ages. Man, knowing that his life will end,
has often been prey to an even more terrible nightmare&mdash;the
end of his whole world. In a scientific age most of the
past terrors have turned out to be senseless chimeras. But
one menace remains. It is the great and permanent unknown:
what will we humans do to each other and to ourselves?</p>
<p>The worry about our own actions will continue. It may
grow as our power over nature increases. Against this worry
there exist two weapons: understanding and courage. Of the
two, courage is more important but understanding must
come first.</p>
<p>We are frequently alarmed by imaginary dangers, while
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
disregarding risks which are much more real. There should
exist a close interaction between public opinion on the one
hand and technical progress on the other. For this end an
understanding of modern scientific developments is required.
There is an increasingly urgent need to know. Little is done
to satisfy this need. The opinion has gained ground that this
need can in fact not be satisfied.</p>
<p>At the same time, more and more people believe that the
scientists and technical people themselves are responsible
for the changes which their ideas and inventions have brought
about. The scientist is put in the position where his voice is
heard, not only in the highly specialized fields in which he
is an expert, but also in the much more general matters which
are affected by his discoveries. The real source of important
decisions in our country is the people. We believe that this
is rightly so, and we believe that it is not proper if scientists
take over any essential part of these decisions.</p>
<p>The responsibility of a technical man certainly includes
two important functions. One is to explore nature and to
find out the possible limits of our power over nature. The
other is to explain what he has found in clear, simple, and
straightforward terms, so that essential decisions can be made
by all the people of our country&mdash;to whom the power of
decision properly belongs, and whom the consequences of
these decisions will ultimately affect.</p>
<p>To explain scientific and technical matters is not easy,
and to become familiar with all science might actually be
impossible. In the specialized field of physics there have been
revolutionary developments in the twentieth century like
the theory of relativity discovered by Einstein and the theory
of the atom originated by Niels Bohr. These new discoveries
are not easy to understand, and every good physicist has spent
years of his life trying to get thoroughly acquainted with their
meaning. All of us who have done so feel that we are well
rewarded by the better understanding of nature which we
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
have acquired. But it is not necessary to talk of these matters
here.</p>
<p>What we have to discuss in this book is connected with
parts of atomic and nuclear physics which are much more
elementary. The facts which we shall present in a simple
fashion are sufficient to give the reader an orientation in the
seemingly bewildering fields of nuclear energy and atomic
explosions.</p>
<p>We shall have to start by describing atoms and nuclei.
These are rather small objects, but this circumstance need
not particularly bother us; and it is not necessary to frighten
ourselves with the idea that we are talking about &ldquo;unimaginably&rdquo;
small objects. Our minds adapt themselves quite
readily to new dimensions; and while we are talking about
nuclei, we can temporarily forget that any bigger objects
exist. Real difficulties arise only when science discovers laws
which seem to contradict common sense. This does not happen
frequently, and we shall not need to dwell upon such
subjects.</p>
<p>The difficulties of explaining science are increased by the
fact that scientists have developed a language of their own
which they practice and perfect by talking to each other. One
sometimes has the impression that they talk to each other
exclusively. The authors feel that their own &ldquo;native tongue&rdquo;
is this scientific language; this book is an effort at a translation.</p>
<p>A further difficulty is connected with the special subject:
radioactivity. The great practical importance of this subject
has dawned upon the public in connection with the explosion
at Hiroshima. This was a frightening occasion, and the subsequent
developments and prospects are no less frightening.
It is not necessary that everything connected with nuclear
explosions should be equally frightening; and it is important
that we should approach the subject with an open mind and
with as few emotions as is humanly possible. The emotions
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
have their necessary place when we get to the stage in which
we want to decide our actions. We suggest to the reader that
he should delay this stage until the time when he has finished
reading the book.</p>
<p>The greatest difficulty in discussing the radiation hazards
arises because the working of living organisms is involved.
Basically, we are in the dark about the question how such an
organism works. We are equally in the dark about the question
how such an organism is affected by radiation. It would
therefore seem that we must remain in doubt whether or not
radioactivity is dangerous, except for those cases where obvious
damage has been done. Since the immediate effects of
radioactivity are not perceived by our senses, we are faced
with the thought of an invisible menace of unknown extent.
Some of the harmful consequences may show up years later,
and therefore even the absence of any observed damage will
not reassure people.</p>
<p>Fortunately, our practical knowledge is by no means as
deficient as these statements would suggest. Radioactivity,
and processes similar to radioactivity, surround us and have
surrounded our ancestors for as long as life has existed on
earth. We do not know what life is, and we do not know in
what detailed manner life is affected by radioactivity; but
we have broadly based and certain knowledge that artificial
radioactivity will produce similar effects to those produced
by the natural background of radioactivity. This background,
therefore, provides us with a yardstick to which all man-made
contaminations can be compared.</p>
<p>There is a final obstacle to the explanation of matters connected
with radioactivity. This is the secrecy which has been
associated with the development of nuclear energy, and in
particular with the military applications of nuclear energy.
The arguments for keeping information concerning weapons
secret are strong, proper, and generally understood. There is,
however, no such strong argument, and in fact no possibility
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
for secrecy connected with the widely dispersed radioactivity
which originates from the weapons. In recognition of this
fact, secrecy has been completely and properly removed from
this field. It is not surprising that it took some time to do so.
Administrative decisions have been involved, and these are
never taken in a very great hurry.</p>
<p>Even though world-wide radioactive contamination has
been since 1955 open to general scientific discussion, the
time does not seem to have been sufficient to insure a wide
dissemination and explanation of the results. There may
also remain some lingering doubts whether all relevant information
has been made available. In actual fact, the scientific
information on this important topic is completely and
freely available at the present time.</p>
<p>Information concerning the peaceful applications of nuclear
energy is also completely and freely available. Even in
the field of military applications, much of the essential information
has been published.</p>
<p>We are therefore in a position to put before the reader
the most important facts about the peaceful and military
applications of nuclear energy&mdash;of the possible dangers and
of the eventual benefits. If we do not succeed, we cannot
blame either secrecy or the difficulty of the subject. It is true
that the subject is involved, but only in the same way as are
those subjects of everyday experience with which all of us
have to struggle once in a while. No greater intellectual
effort is needed than is involved in the understanding of the
income tax form or the racing form, to mention two analogies
of rather diverse emotional content. Many of the ideas
will be unfamiliar, but they are not complex. Furthermore,
their bearing on our safety, well-being, and the possible improvement
of our lives is great. Therefore we hope that the
reader will give as much of his attention to this matter as he
is accustomed to devote to other subjects which are connected
with his necessities or his amusement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />Atoms</h2>
<p>All matter is composed of atoms, which are
very tiny objects. We cannot see them because waves of light
wash over them like ocean waves over a pebble. An atom is
about as big in comparison to a human cell, which can be
clearly seen under an ordinary microscope, as a human cell
is in comparison to a billiard ball. Somewhat more precisely,
a hundred million atoms laid side by side would be about an
inch in length.</p>
<p>Despite its Greek name, which means indivisible, the atom
is made up of parts. It consists of a central nucleus, which
carries a positive electrical charge, around which one or more
negatively charged electrons are distributed. One frequently
hears of the electrons revolving in orbits around the nucleus,
somewhat as the planets revolve around the sun in our own
solar system. This is not quite a correct picture, however.
For one thing the electrons are more elusive than the planets.
They do not revolve in definite orbits as the planets do. Also
the orbits are more delicate. One would destroy the atom by
the attempt to find out precisely what the electron orbits are.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<div class="img" id="fig1">
<img src="images/p00.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="507" />
<p class="pcap">This is how an atom does <i>not</i> look. The electrons do not move
along well-defined paths. It is more difficult to convey the idea of
an atom by a picture than it is to make a drawing of last night&rsquo;s
dream.</p>
</div>
<p>The planets do not fly away from the sun because of the
gravitational attraction which the sun exerts. The electrons
and the nucleus, however, are held together because positive
and negative electrical charges attract each other. The gravitational
attraction between the electrons and the nucleus is
incredibly weak compared to the electrical attraction.</p>
<p>Most of the atom&rsquo;s weight comes from its nucleus. Even
the lightest known nucleus weighs about 1840 times as much
as an electron. In spite of this, the nucleus occupies only a
tiny portion of the total volume of the atom. In fact, the
nucleus is about as big in comparison to the whole atom as the
atom is in comparison to the human cell. Twenty thousand
nuclei laid side by side would be about equal in length to
the diameter of the atom. If matter were composed of nothing
but nuclei densely packed together, an object the size of a
penny would weigh approximately forty million tons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Later we are going to see that the size of the nucleus has
a great effect upon the ways in which nuclei react with each
other. For that very reason the size of the nucleus is a well-defined
measurable quantity. It is much harder to say precisely
what one means by the size of the electron. It seems
acceptable to say that it is somewhat less than the size of the
average nucleus. In any case it is certain that both the electrons
and the nucleus are small compared to the size of the
whole atom. Consequently, the atom must consist mostly of
empty space. This means, of course, that when you look at
solid matter, what is before your eyes is empty space with
a slight addition of real substance. What lends strength to
solids is the interplay of electric attractions and repulsions
inside atoms and between atoms.</p>
<p>When a charged particle, such as an electron or a nucleus,
happens to move through solid matter, it is constantly acted
on by large electric forces. To such a particle matter does
not seem to be very transparent. But if there were such a
thing as an electrically neutral particle, comparable in size
to the nucleus, it would be able to move around freely inside
matter, without experiencing electric forces, and only now
and again bumping into a nucleus or maybe an electron. As
a matter of fact, there is such a particle and it can pass right
through an inch or two of solid matter without bumping into
anything. Later on in this book we shall be very interested
in this particle, which is called a neutron.</p>
<p>Although the electrons and the nucleus are charged particles,
the atom as a whole is electrically neutral; this means
that the positive charge of the nucleus must be equal in
magnitude to the total charge of all the negative electrons.
All electrons have precisely the same charge, which is the
smallest charge that has ever been observed. What is particularly
strange and not yet explained is the fact that all other
charges are as big as the electron charge, or twice as big, or
three times as big, or a million times as big. But we never
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
find a charge which, expressed in terms of the electron
charge, is fractional. No object ever carries three and a half
electron charges. The electron charge therefore may be used
conveniently as a standard unit of charge.</p>
<p>Every atom can be distinguished by the charge of its
nucleus. The simplest atom one can imagine would clearly
be one with a single electron revolving around a nucleus
having one unit of positive charge. Such an atom exists and
is called hydrogen. An atom with a nucleus of charge two
and two electrons revolving around it, is called helium;
three, lithium ... six, seven, eight; carbon, nitrogen, oxygen
... 92, uranium. Atoms with almost all charges from one
to 92 are found in nature, and practically none above 92 are
found. Some odd charges&mdash;43, 61, 85, and 87&mdash;are missing.
The reason for these missing atoms is connected with the
properties of the nucleus. The nucleus will soon become our
main object of interest.</p>
<p>The most surprising fact about atoms is their similarity,
indeed their identical behavior. If two atoms have the same
kind of nucleus and have the same number of electrons revolving
around these nuclei, then these two atoms are apt
to be encountered in a condition which is most precisely the
same for the two. One could imagine that the various component
parts of the atom would be arranged in different ways
and found in different states of motion, in a variety without
limit. Whence the complete similarity? The answer to this
question is not only most surprising, but it is even in apparent
contradiction to common sense. For this very reason
it is difficult to explain. The hardest things to understand
are not those which are complicated but those which are
unexpected.</p>
<p>Fortunately for our purpose we need not go into this more
intricate portion of atomic physics. It is sufficient to say that
there is one arrangement or pattern of motion of the electrons
which is preferred and which leads to the greatest stability
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
of the atom. If the electrons are in this particular state
of motion, which is called the ground state, they have less
energy than they would have if they were in any other state
of motion. There are other less stable, but not less sharply
defined, states of atoms which we call &ldquo;excited&rdquo; states. When
an atom is in such an excited state, it tends to be unstable
and tries to get into the ground state as soon as possible.
Since the ground state contains less energy than any other
state, the atom must release energy in the process of adjustment.
The released energy manifests itself in the form of
electromagnetic radiation&mdash;often as a little pulse of visible
light. The color of this light depends upon the amount of
energy released, going progressively through the rainbow
from red toward blue as the amount of energy increases.</p>
<p>There are very few states in which the excitation energy
is small. But of strongly excited states there is a great abundance.
In the region of this high excitation small additional
changes are possible. Thus we approach a situation more in
accordance with experience and common sense: the pattern
of motion can be changed by any small amount.</p>
<p>The description we have just given is of course incomplete.
We must avoid here the crucial questions why only some patterns
of motion are possible, why one lowest level is stable
and why the electrons never descend into decreasing states
of energy, following the attraction of the nucleus. At the
same time one should emphasize that a complete explanation
of these facts has been given. This explanation makes precise
predictions about many of the properties of matter, and we
can have complete confidence that, but for the involved
mathematical procedure, all ordinary properties of materials
could be precisely predicted. The atom has been explained
as completely as Newton has explained the motion of planets.</p>
<p>To form an idea what an atom is or why two atoms of, let
us say, hydrogen are precisely the same, it is not necessary
to search for intricate reasons or deep meanings. Two atoms
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
of the same kind are alike as two pawns are for the chess
player, except for one little point: in the case of the pawns
we do not <i>care</i> about the difference; in the case of the atoms
there <i>is</i> no difference. This is a simple statement and it honestly
describes a simple situation. The beauty of science is
due to the fact that the correct answers to our most interesting
questions have turned out to be surprising by their
simplicity.</p>
<p>In order to understand an atom one must consider the
distribution of electrons around one nucleus. In order to
understand a molecule one has to consider the distribution
of electrons around two or more nuclei. The <i>chemical</i> behavior
of an atom is the manner in which it interacts with
other atoms, and that means the precise way in which the
electrons rearrange themselves when two or more atoms
approach each other. The interaction between atoms occurs
mainly between their outermost electrons. It may happen
that two quite different atoms, containing nuclei of different
charges and different numbers of electrons, may nevertheless
be similar in the structure of their outermost electrons. In
this case the two atoms exhibit similar chemical properties.
Examples are lithium with charge 3 and sodium with charge
11; also helium, charge 2 and neon, charge 10. A most important
example for our purpose is the set of three chemically
similar atoms: calcium, charge 20, strontium, charge 38; and
radium, charge 88.</p>
<p>When two or more atoms approach each other, whether
they are similar or different, their electrons&mdash;particularly the
outermost ones&mdash;find new states of motion instead of those
that were available to them when there was only one nucleus
in the vicinity. It may now happen that amongst these new
states of motion there are some that are even more stable
than the state of the separated atoms. In this event the atoms
will tend to stick together, and the electrons will adopt whatever
new state of motion now corresponds to maximum stability.
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
The composite system of the atoms is called a molecule,
and its state of maximum stability, the ground state of
the molecule.</p>
<p>There are atoms of particularly great stability which cannot
increase their stability by combining with other atoms.
Examples are helium, neon, and argon. These atoms tend to
remain single, retain their independent motion in a rather
&ldquo;permanent&rdquo; gaseous state, and are generally unsociable.
They are called therefore the noble gases.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>An especially simple example of the formation of a molecule
is the combining of sodium and chlorine to form ordinary
table salt. The sodium atom happens to have a rather
loosely bound outer electron. The chlorine atom possesses
a convenient niche for an extra electron. Consequently the
energy spent in prying the outer electron loose from the sodium
atom is largely repaid by adding it to the chlorine atom.
The remaining sodium &ldquo;atom,&rdquo; deprived of one of its electrons,
now has a net positive charge.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> The chlorine &ldquo;atom&rdquo;
with its extra electron has a net negative charge. The two
&ldquo;atoms&rdquo; therefore attract each other to make a molecule of
sodium chloride. Actually matter will continue to aggregate.
A great number of positive sodium &ldquo;atoms&rdquo; and negative
chlorine &ldquo;atoms&rdquo; will arrange themselves into a beautiful
and regular lattice which is the sodium chloride crystal.</p>
<p>The simplest molecule which does not tend to grow into a
bigger aggregate is made up of two hydrogen atoms. Around
two hydrogen nuclei a particularly stable pattern of two electrons
can be formed. Because of this fact hydrogen atoms
associate pairwise so that this pattern should become possible.</p>
<p>The ways in which atoms can be joined are incredibly
manifold. They can form metals in which the outer electrons
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
roam freely and carry electric currents with the greatest of
ease. They can form liquids in which atoms or molecules
are tied together in a loose and disorderly fashion. They can
move independently making occasional encounters, which
is what happens in a gas. And they can form long spiraling
molecules where groups of atoms are strung together without
an apparent simple order, but in a way which is somehow
related to the processes of life.</p>

<p class="pcap">Arrangement of sodium and chlorine &ldquo;atoms&rdquo; in a crystal of
common salt.</p>
</div>
<p>We all know in how many forms matter can appear and
how changeable these forms are. That the stone and the spray,
the air and an insect, and even the human brain should be
composed of the same few kinds of atoms, and that these
atoms should be subject to laws which are subtle and simple
and precisely described&mdash;this certainly is the most remarkable
fact that we have learned since Newton proved that the

<br />Nuclei</h2>
<p>Up to now we have regarded atoms as being
divisible into electrons and nuclei. Electrons and nuclei, however,
we have regarded as indivisible entities. This point of
view is perfectly adequate to account for all the facts of
chemistry and most of the facts of physics. Even in physics,
it has not been necessary to ascribe an internal structure to
the electron.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> The electron is a truly elementary particle in
this sense. However, to understand some physical phenomena,
and radioactivity is one of these, it is necessary to recognize
that the nucleus is not indivisible but consists of parts. The
parts of the nucleus are called protons and neutrons.</p>
<p>The simple statements of the previous chapter apply to
these smaller particles also. All electrons are equal&mdash;precisely
equal. All protons are equal and all neutrons are equal.
There are methods which would have shown up exceedingly
small differences between these particles. No such differences
have been discovered. As far as we know these particles are
<i>always</i> the same. We cannot pour energy into them and excite
them as was the case with the atoms. When we come to
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
consider these small particles, the complex structure of the
world has an end. Instead what we find is simple.</p>
<p>A proton and a neutron have almost exactly the same
weight. The proton has one unit of positive charge, which
means that its charge is the same as that of the electron except
that it is opposite in sign. The neutron, as its name implies,
is an electrically neutral particle. Hence the charge of the
nucleus is equal to the number of protons it contains, and
is independent of the number of neutrons. The weight of
the nucleus, however, taking the proton (or the neutron) as
a unit of weight, is equal to the number of protons <i>plus</i> the
number of neutrons.</p>
<p>Imagine that we have two atoms whose nuclei have the
same number of protons but a different number of neutrons.
Such atoms exist in nature and are called isotopes. The point
about these isotopes is that since they have the same number
of protons, they have the same nuclear charge, the same electron
structures, and hence they have almost the same chemical
properties. Their nuclei have somewhat different volumes.
But the nucleus is small in any case. It is almost as
though we tried to look for the difference between nothing
and twice-nothing. The difference in the weights of isotopes
due to the difference in their numbers of neutrons, has only
a negligible influence on their chemical behavior. An important
consequence of this fact is that molecules which differ
only in that one isotope has been substituted for another
are biologically indistinguishable. They taste the same and
smell the same. They are ingested in our bodies in the same
way, and they are deposited or excreted in the same way.</p>
<p>The simplest isotopes are the isotopes of hydrogen. Most
of the hydrogen atoms we find in nature have a nucleus which
is a single proton. This is the common hydrogen or light hydrogen.
A few hydrogen atoms, however, have nuclei which
consist of a proton and a neutron. This is the heavy hydrogen,
found in heavy water. In all natural sources of water these
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
two kinds of hydrogen are mixed in a ratio which is practically
the same for every sample. The electron circulating
around the nucleus behaves almost exactly the same way
whether the extra neutron is present or not. On the state of
that electron depend most properties of the atom and the
molecules which contain it. Of course, heavy hydrogen has
twice the weight of common hydrogen, and heavy water is
somewhat more dense than light water. But otherwise there
is little difference.</p>
<p>The story of the discovery of the hydrogen isotopes is
amusing. About half a century ago&mdash;before the discovery of
any isotope&mdash;two scientists tried to measure the density of
water. They purified the water by boiling it and condensing
the vapor. But the more they purified, the lighter it became&mdash;slightly
but perceptibly. Finally they gave up: water seemed
to have no density!</p>
<p>What really happened was this: Light water boils a little
bit more easily than heavy water. Without realizing it, these
scientists had started to separate isotopes.</p>
<p>Many years later Harold Urey&mdash;on the basis of some mistaken
experiments of other people&mdash;concluded that heavy
hydrogen must exist. He looked for it and found it, but
found much less than he had expected. There was so little
heavy hydrogen that on the basis of correct experiments
Urey never would have guessed its presence. It seems that an
unfounded idea is much more fruitful than the absence of
an idea.</p>
<p>Almost all naturally occurring elements are found to consist
of more than one isotope. Uranium, for example, is composed
mainly of two, one having 143 neutrons and the other
having 146. Since both of these isotopes have 92 protons,
their weights are 92 + 143 = 235 and 92 + 146 = 238
respectively. It is customary to refer to these isotopes as U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309;
and U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312;. The U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309;, which is valuable in atomic reactors and
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
in the manufacture of atomic bombs, is comparatively rare,
occurring as only one part in 140 of natural uranium. The
separation of this rare isotope from the common 238 was one
of the major undertakings of the two billion dollar Manhattan
Project during World War II.</p>
<p>We come now to a most important question, one that will
lead us to the idea of radioactivity: What is it that determines
which isotopes a given element will have? For example, uranium
has isotopes weighing 235 and 238. Small amounts of
U&sup2;&sup3;&#8308; and U&sup2;&sup3;&#8310; are also found in nature. Why do we not find
U&sup2;&sup3;&sup2;, U&sup2;&sup3;&sup3;, U&sup2;&sup3;&#8311; or U&sup2;&sup3;&#8313;? Evidently only certain numbers of
neutrons will hang together with 92 protons.</p>
<p>Consider another example, this time of the lightest known
element, hydrogen. We have already mentioned two isotopes
of hydrogen: light hydrogen with weight 1 (symbolized H&sup1;),
having a nucleus consisting of a single proton and no neutrons,
and heavy hydrogen (also called deuterium) of weight 2
(H&sup2;), having one proton and one neutron. The latter isotope
occurs as only about one part in 5,000 of natural hydrogen.
There is also a slight trace of tritium (H&sup3;), having one proton
and two neutrons. But here the sequence stops. What has
happened to H&#8308;, H&#8309;, H&#8310;, etc?</p>
<p>This question is related to the earlier one: why there are
no atoms in nature of charge 43, 61, 85, and 87, and why
there are none with charges greater than 92. To answer these
questions requires a little knowledge about the laws which
govern the motion of neutrons and protons within the nucleus,
and the nature of the forces which are exerted by a
neutron on a neutron, a neutron on a proton, and a proton
on a proton.</p>
<p>The motion of neutrons and protons within the nucleus
is governed by the same laws which govern the motion of
electrons within the atom. For both the nucleus and the atom
there is a ground state of motion which has more stability
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
(less energy) than any other state. Of course the arrangement
and motion of electrons in the atom depend not only on this
general rule but also on the specifically electrical nature of
the forces which act between the electrons and the nucleus.
In the same way the arrangement and motion of the neutrons
and protons within the nucleus depend upon the nature of
the forces which act between neutrons and protons.</p>
<p>These forces are definitely not of gravitational origin.
Gravitational attraction is extremely weak compared to the
attraction between neutrons and protons, and is utterly negligible
in the realm of nuclear phenomena. Neither can the
nuclear forces be electrical in origin. The neutrons are electrically
neutral; and the protons actually repel each other by
virtue of their electrical charge. The nuclear forces are something
entirely new. They are the strongest forces yet encountered,
and they are without a counterpart in the macroscopic
world.</p>
<p>Nuclear forces are not yet completely understood. But to
understand nuclear stability we need to know only one peculiar
fact governing the behavior of neutrons and protons
(and incidentally also electrons): They want to be different.
To each particle a state or pattern of motion can be assigned.
When any two neutrons are compared, their pattern of motion
must be essentially different. The same holds for any
two protons. A neutron and a proton, however, may be found
in similar patterns since they differ anyway in their charge.</p>
<p>Now among the possible patterns of motion some have
lower and some have higher energies. Individual neutrons
and protons will first occupy the lowest energy states, in accordance
with the rule of least energy for maximum stability.
Then the demand for a difference will force subsequent particles
into patterns of higher and higher energies.</p>
<p>Since a neutron does not exclude a proton from being in
the same pattern, the lowest energy state may be occupied
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
simultaneously by one neutron and one proton.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> If another
neutron or proton is added, it must be put into the next state
of higher energy. For this reason we would expect that nuclei
are most stable when they contain an equal or nearly equal
number of neutrons and protons. For nuclei which are not
too heavy, this is indeed the case. For example, nitrogen,
which has seven protons, has two stable isotopes, N&sup1;&#8308; and N&sup1;&#8309;,
with seven and eight neutrons respectively. For heavy nuclei,
however, the situation is a little different.</p>
<p>The nuclear force between neutrons and protons acts only
over a very short range&mdash;the particles must almost be in contact
with each other in order to experience a sizeable attraction.
Consequently a neutron or a proton interacts only with
its immediate neighbors in the nucleus. The electrical repulsion
between the protons, however, acts over a much
longer range. A proton is repelled by all the other protons
in the nucleus. For heavy nuclei this repulsion is sufficient
to reduce the number of protons relative to the number of
neutrons. Lead, for example, with 82 protons, has four stable
isotopes, with 122, 124, 125, and 126 neutrons.</p>
<p>We have said that seven protons will combine stably with
seven or eight neutrons. What happens if seven protons are
combined with six or nine neutrons (to make N&sup1;&sup3; or N&sup1;&#8310;)?
Our rule does not prevent them from sticking together; it
says only that these combinations would be <i>more</i> stable if a
proton could be converted into a neutron (in the case of six)
or a neutron into a proton (in the case of nine).</p>
<p>Actually seven protons and nine neutrons <i>do</i> stick together,
but such a nucleus is not stable and does not continue to exist
indefinitely. The reason is quite simple and a little surprising:
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
The conversion of a neutron into a proton is actually
a physically realizable process, and furthermore it releases
some energy. Similarly a nucleus containing seven protons
and six neutrons will have an existence of only finite duration
because the conversion of a proton into a neutron can
also occur. Of course the proton is charged and the neutron
is not. What happens to the charge during these transformations?
Actually the neutron is transformed, not into a proton,
but into a proton plus an electron. The proton is transformed
likewise into a neutron plus something else. This something
else is called a positron and is identical with the electron in
every respect except in having a positive instead of a negative
charge.</p>
<p>The changes just described occur spontaneously. They
are examples of radioactivity. More specifically they are called
&ldquo;beta decay&rdquo; processes because an electron (or a positron)
when emitted by a nucleus is called a beta ray. Such beta-radioactive
substances are produced whenever nuclear energy
is used in an explosion or in a power plant. Many of the
difficulties and worries concerning nuclear energy are connected
with these beta activities. We shall be concerned with
them often as harmful, sometimes as helpful agents.</p>
<p>When a neutron is converted into a proton and an electron
inside a nucleus, the electron escapes immediately, but the
proton remains in the nucleus. Similarly, when a proton is
converted into a neutron and a positron, the positron escapes
and the neutron remains in the nucleus. Since the electron
and the positron have a negligible weight compared to a
proton or a neutron, the process of beta decay leaves the
weight of the nucleus nearly unchanged. Since the electron
and the positron are charged, the process of beta decay increases
or decreases the charge of the nucleus by one unit.</p>
<p>After beta decay a nitrogen nucleus with seven protons and
six neutrons (N&sup1;&sup3;) becomes a nucleus with six protons and
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
seven neutrons&mdash;carbon with weight 13 (C&sup1;&sup3;), which is a
stable combination. Similarly a nitrogen nucleus with seven
protons and nine neutrons (N&sup1;&#8310;) becomes a nucleus with eight
protons and eight neutrons, oxygen with weight 16 (O&sup1;&#8310;),
which is ordinary stable oxygen.</p>
<p>Sometimes after a beta decay the residual nucleus finds
itself with a &ldquo;correct&rdquo; number of neutrons and protons but
with an excess of energy. That is, the residual nucleus is not
in its ground state but is excited. This happens in about two
thirds of the known cases of beta decay. It happens, for instance,
when N&sup1;&#8310; decays to O&sup1;&#8310;.</p>
<p>In this situation the excited nucleus will behave like an
excited atom. An excited atom, the reader will recall, gets
rid of its excess energy by emitting electromagnetic radiation,
usually visible or near-visible light. The excited nucleus will
get rid of its excess energy in exactly the same way. The only
difference is that the amount of energy carried by the electromagnetic
radiation from the nucleus is approximately a
million times greater than that carried by the electromagnetic
radiation from the atom&mdash;an indication of the large quantity
of energy stored up inside the nucleus. Such energetic electromagnetic
radiation emanating from a nucleus is usually
called a gamma ray. Gamma-ray emission, or gamma decay,
like beta decay, is an energy-releasing process which changes
an unstable nucleus into a stable one, or at least into a more
stable one. More generally, any spontaneous energy-releasing
process (which tends to stabilize the nucleus) is called radioactivity.
Beta and gamma decay are two examples. Later on
we shall consider a third example called alpha decay. An
alpha particle is the nucleus of the helium atom and consists
of two neutrons and two protons.</p>
<p>The decay of a neutron and the decay of a proton appear
to be quite analogous processes. Actually there is an important
difference between the two. A free neutron&mdash;one not
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
confined inside a nucleus&mdash;will decay into a proton and an
electron; but a free proton will not decay into a neutron and
a positron. This difference is due to the fact that the proton
has a slightly lower weight than the neutron and therefore
has less energy. For the proton to decay, it must be inside a
nucleus where it can absorb some energy from the other
protons and neutrons.</p>
<p>One sometimes finds pairs of nuclei which could transform
into each other by a proton-neutron (or neutron-proton) conversion;
nevertheless neither of these conversions can occur
in the way we have just described. The reason is that in a
proton-neutron or neutron-proton conversion an additional
electron or positron has to be emitted. Now according to
Einstein the mass of the electron or positron corresponds to
some energy (E = mc&sup2;), and it may happen that neither the
neutron-proton transformation or the proton-neutron transformation
releases enough energy to make an electron or a
positron.</p>
<p>In such cases one of the innermost electrons of the atom
may combine with a proton to make a neutron. Such an electron-capture
process will always release energy provided that
the reverse process&mdash;the transformation of a neutron into a
proton and an electron&mdash;is connected with an energy deficit.
Thus, excluding the possibility of a really exact coincidence
of two energies, one of the two transformations from neutron
to proton or proton to neutron will always be possible.</p>
<p>It is one of the most firmly established laws of nature that
energy is always conserved. One would therefore expect that
the energy of a beta ray would be exactly equal to the difference
between the energy of the nucleus before the beta decay
and the energy of the nucleus after the beta decay. As a matter
of fact the energy of a beta ray is found never to be as
great as this amount. Frequently it is much less. Some of the
energy has apparently disappeared and the suspicion has been
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
voiced that energy may not be conserved after all. It has
turned out, however, that the missing energy is smuggled
out of the nucleus, and the smuggler (who has only recently
been caught) is called the neutrino.</p>
<p>The neutrino is an electrically neutral particle, like the
neutron, but its weight, like the weight of a ray of light, is
equal to zero. Like such a ray, it moves with the velocity of
light.</p>
<p>The energy released by the nucleus in the beta-decay process
is shared more or less equally between the neutrino and
the beta ray. We shall see later that the electron gives rise to
a number of effects. Some of these are harmful. The neutrino,
however, is not in the least dangerous. Like an ideal smuggler
it passes unnoticed and practically without a trace. It
interacts so slightly with matter that several billion of them
may go right through the whole sphere of our earth before
a single collision occurs.</p>
<p>Very recently this strange little particle has upset one of
our most unquestioned concepts about symmetry. We have
always believed that nature made no distinction between her
right hand and her left hand; that for every natural process
that exists, there exists also the mirror image of this process.
The neutrino, however, is an exception. It has a definite
symmetry, like a screw.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> This fact may turn out to be most
important in the development of science. It has no bearing,
however, on the questions to be discussed in this book.</p>
<p>Neutrinos reach us from some distant and hidden places
like the interior of our sun and of exploding stars. It may
become possible to use neutrinos as messengers to reveal the
kind of nuclear reactions from which the energy of the stars
is derived.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Neutrinos are also emitted every time we release some nuclear
energy. Among all the remarkable practical consequences
of nuclear energy, the neutrinos have a unique distinction:
they are never useful, and they are never harmful.
They have not even been suspected of any mischief.</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />The Law of Radioactive Decay</h2>
<p>A radioactive nucleus is one that will eventually
disintegrate and release some energy. But when?</p>
<p>One might imagine that a radioactive nucleus would begin
to &ldquo;age&rdquo; from the moment of its birth, and that after the
passage of a predetermined time, the disintegration process
would take place. This is how radioactivity <i>might</i> work in a
deterministic universe. What actually happens to a radioactive
nucleus, however, is much more interesting.</p>
<p>At any instant of its life, the radioactive nucleus has some
probability of disintegrating in the next second. This probability
is unaffected by its age. No matter how long the nucleus
has lived, its chance of disintegrating in the next second is
always the same. It is as if a game of roulette were being
played. The wheel spins, and if its number comes up, the nucleus
disintegrates in the first second. If not, the wheel spins
again. Each time the wheel spins there is some probability
of its number coming up. The precise value of this probability
is a characteristic of each particular radioactive species.
The higher the probability, the more rapidly the nucleus
may be expected to disintegrate. But a given nucleus need
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
not do at any particular time what is expected of it.</p>
<p>The notion of probability (or chance) has meaning only
when applied to a large number of cases. To say that a given
nucleus has one chance in a hundred of decaying in the next
second means that out of some large number (say 100 million)
of such radioactive nuclei, one per cent (one million)
will decay in the next second. But it is absolutely impossible
to say beforehand which nuclei will be the ones to decay. A
particular nucleus may decay immediately or only after some
very long time. The collection as a whole, however, will always
do the expected thing. (This is the principle on which
insurance companies operate.)</p>
<p>The situation is best described in terms of a time span
which is called the half-life of the radioactive species. The
half-life is defined as the amount of time which is required
for one half of a large number of identical radioactive nuclei
to disintegrate. It makes no difference what this large number
is, provided only that it is large enough.</p>
<p>If the number is not large enough, fluctuations will occur,
and instead of 50 per cent of the nuclei decaying during the
period of a half-life, it may be 40 per cent or 60 per cent. As
a matter of fact the 40 per cent to 60 per cent limits correspond
to a sample size of about 100 nuclei. For 10,000 nuclei,
the limits will be 49 per cent to 51 per cent. The number of
radioactive nuclei with which we customarily deal, is about
10&sup2;&sup3; (100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000). This is the number,
for example, of radioactive nuclei in about an ounce of radium.
For such a large number of nuclei the deviation from
50-per-cent decay during a half-life will be utterly negligible.
Thus we live in a universe which, on a macroscopic scale, appears
ordered and subject to exact laws; while underlying
these laws, on a microscopic scale, nature plays out a game
of chance, full of randomness and uncertainty in the individual
case.</p>
<p>We may draw a graph showing how <i>N</i>, the number of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
remaining radioactive nuclei, varies with the time <i>t</i>. The
graph shows that: in the first half-life <i>T</i>, half of the original
number <i>N</i>&#8320; of radioactive nuclei decay. In the second half-life,
half of those remaining decay, and so on. After the time
<i>T</i>, one half of the original radioactive nuclei still remain;
after 2<i>T</i>, one quarter remain; and so forth.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" id="ncfig1" alt="uncaptioned" width="800" height="470" />
</div>
<p>Different radioactive species have different half-lives. Many
are only a small fraction of a second; some are billions of
years. N&sup1;&#8310; decays to O&sup1;&#8310; (plus an electron and a neutrino)
with a half-life of about eight seconds. A free neutron decays
into a proton, an electron, and a neutrino with a half-life of
13 minutes. Strontium with weight 90 (Sr&#8313;&#8304;) undergoes a beta
decay with a half-life of 28 years. (This is an isotope that is
not found anywhere in nature, but is made in fairly large
quantities in the fission process.) Potassium with weight 40
(K&#8308;&#8304;), which is present in the amount of 0.01 per cent in
ordinary potassium, has a half-life of one billion years. It
has presumably been left over from the time when the primordial
elements were formed. Half-lives for gamma decay
are extremely short by comparison to those for beta decay.
They usually amount to a small fraction of a second.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Radioactivity is characterized by the kind of particle
emitted from the nucleus (our examples, so far, have been of
beta and gamma particles), by the energy possessed by this
particle, and by the half-life in which the radioactive decay
takes place.</p>
<p>The biological hazard from radioactivity depends on all
three of these characteristics. No matter whether the radioactive
nuclei are produced in an atomic explosion or in an
atomic reactor, some time will in general elapse before a
human population can become exposed. If this time is long
compared to the half-life of the radioactive species, most of
the nuclei will have disintegrated, and the hazard will thereby
be reduced. If, on the other hand, the half-life is long compared
to this time, as well as to the life-span of a human being,
the rate at which disintegrations occur will be low, and
again the hazard will be reduced.</p>
<p>In short the dangerous half-lives are the intermediate ones,
not too long, not too short. Sr&#8313;&#8304; is an example.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />Breakup of the Nucleus</h2>
<p>The positive electric charges within an atomic
nucleus repel one another. In the most heavily charged
nuclei this repulsion becomes so great that the nucleus can
break into two parts, simultaneously releasing a considerable
amount of energy. In the case of <i>spontaneous nuclear fission</i>
the two parts are more or less equal in size. In the process of
<i>alpha decay</i> one of the parts (the alpha particle) is much
smaller than the other.</p>
<p>An alpha particle consists of two neutrons and two protons
and is identical with the nucleus of the helium atom. (The
symbol for this nucleus is He&#8308;.) Since two neutrons and two
protons can simultaneously occupy the lowest energy state,
the alpha particle is an especially stable nuclear unit. As a result,
from time to time in heavy nuclei, two neutrons and
two protons will coalesce into an alpha particle, which may
then attempt to escape.</p>
<p>In attempting to escape from the nucleus, however, an
alpha particle encounters considerable resistance because of
the short-range nuclear attraction of the other neutrons and
protons. This resistance which an alpha particle experiences
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
in trying to leave the nucleus is usually referred to as an &ldquo;energy
barrier.&rdquo; If the alpha particle could acquire a little additional
energy, it would be able to overcome the barrier and
get away from the nuclear attraction. Once outside the nucleus,
just beyond the reach of the nuclear attraction, the
alpha particle would be accelerated violently outward by the
large electrical repulsion between its two protons and the
other protons in the residual nucleus.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="472" />
<p class="pcap">How an alpha particle escapes from the nucleus. From A to B it
goes &ldquo;uphill,&rdquo; losing speed. At B its speed is zero and it almost
always turns around. With a small probability it may sneak
through the energy barrier B to C. Beyond C, it is repelled and
emerges with increasing speed.</p>
</div>
<p>The alpha particle needs some extra energy to escape. According
to the laws of older physics there is no possibility for
it to obtain this extra energy and therefore escape is impossible.
But the more newly discovered laws governing the motion
of neutrons and protons (the laws of quantum mechanics)
are not so stringent; they permit the alpha particle to use
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
&ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; energy to overcome the energy barrier. Of course
the alpha particle must always repay the loan&mdash;which it can
easily do out of the large fund of electric energy that is released
when it gets out of the repulsive range of the residual
nucleus. There is no interest on the loan.</p>
<p>Such energy loans are not automatically granted in nature.
There are two factors which make the loan improbable: if the
amount is big or if the term is long. These restrictions effectively
limit the particles which may apply for an energy loan.
Objects of great size and weight are unable to qualify, but the
small particles of the atomic world often do.</p>
<p>The more energy carried off by the alpha particle after the
alpha decay, the less energy must be borrowed in order to
overcome the barrier, and the more rapidly the decay may be
expected to occur. So sensitive is the decay to the energy of
the alpha particle, that an alpha particle carrying twice the
energy is emitted a hundred trillion times fester.</p>
<p>Half-lives for alpha decay vary from a fraction of a second
to billions of years. But even the shortest half-life for alpha
decay is remarkably long compared to the time required for
the alpha particle to cross the nucleus. This means that
the alpha particle makes a tremendous number of attempts to
escape from the nucleus before it actually succeeds. According
to the older classical theory the alpha process should never
occur, and in fact it occurs with a very small probability.</p>
<p>A single alpha decay is not usually a sufficient process to
bring about stability of the daughter nucleus. A whole chain
of radioactive decays is usually required before stability is
achieved. Most nuclei which emit alpha particles belong to
one of these radioactive decay chains.</p>
<p>The heavy nuclei for which alpha decay occurs all contain
a large excess of neutrons. Since the alpha particle carries off
exactly two neutrons and two protons, the ratio of the number
of neutrons to the number of protons is increased in the
daughter nucleus. This has an unstabilizing influence. (Actually,
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
in lighter nuclei stability requires that the ratio of neutrons
to protons be closer to unity.) The daughter nucleus is
thus apt to be beta-active, converting a neutron into a proton
(plus an electron and a neutrino) in order to decrease its ratio
of neutrons to protons. In this way a chain of radioactive decays
may occur, more or less alternating between alpha and
beta emissions, with gamma rays being occasionally emitted
also.</p>
<p>There are four radioactive chains. One of them starts with
the abundant isotope of uranium, U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312;. This isotope undergoes
a few alpha decays and a couple of beta decays to become
radium, which has a charge of 88 and a weight of 226. All the
radium in the world is produced in this manner as a daughter
product in the fifth decay of the chain. After a number of further
decays, stable lead (weight 206) is produced and the
chain terminates.</p>
<p>The other chains are similar to the U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312; chain, though not
quite as long. One chain starts with the rare isotope of uranium,
U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309;; another starts with the isotope of thorium that
weighs 232. Both of these terminate in stable isotopes of lead.
In all cases the first decay of the chain has a very long half-life.
The half-life of U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312; is 4.5 billion years; of U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309;, 710 million
years; and of thorium, 14 billion years.</p>
<p>The fourth radioactive chain has been made in the laboratory
but is not found in nature because its first isotope, neptunium
with weight 237, has too short a half-life. It decays in
two million years and all the other members of the chain live
for even shorter periods. Thus the neptunium chain decayed
long ago, whereas the three other chains have survived from
the time when the elements were made.</p>
<p>It is interesting to notice that the lesser abundance of U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309;,
as compared with U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312;, is connected with its shorter half-life.
Assuming that comparable amounts of both isotopes were
present at the beginning of the universe (and there is good
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
reason to believe that this was the case), one would expect to
find significantly less U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309; than U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312; after a period of a few
hundred million years. After 710 million years (the half-life
for U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309;) only one half of the original number of U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309; nuclei
would still exist. But 90 per cent of the original U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312; nuclei
(half-life 4.5 billion years) would remain. From the presently
observed ratio of U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309; to U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312; nuclei (1 to 139), it may be calculated,
using the law of radioactive decay, that 6 billion
years ago natural uranium consisted of equal parts of U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309;
and U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312;. The age of the universe is hotly debated. With
each passing year the universe seems to be a billion years
older. Right now six billion years does not seem widely off
the mark.</p>
<p>Natural radioactivity occurs mainly among the heavy elements,
but there are a few light elements that are naturally
radioactive. Of these, potassium&#8308;&#8304; is an especially interesting
one because it can decay either by electron emission or by
electron capture. The processes are:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">potassium&#8308;&#8304; &rarr; calcium&#8308;&#8304; + electron + neutrino,</p>
<p class="t3">(1.1 billion years)</p>
</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">potassium&#8308;&#8304; + electron &rarr; argon&#8308;&#8304; + neutrino.</p>
<p class="t3">(11 billion years)</p>
</div>
<p>Calcium&#8308;&#8304; and argon&#8308;&#8304; are both stable nuclei. The second
reaction is followed immediately by a gamma ray emission
from the argon&#8308;&#8304;. The one per cent of argon found in the
earth&rsquo;s atmosphere comes almost entirely from the second
reaction. These radioactivities are also interesting because appreciable
amounts of potassium&#8308;&#8304; are always present in human
tissue.</p>
<p>All nuclei at the heavy end of the periodic system are radioactive
alpha emitters. Uranium, for example, has no stable
isotopes; they all undergo alpha decay. But there is another
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
mode of spontaneous decay of uranium, which is much less
frequent than alpha decay but is of much greater practical
importance. This is the fission process.</p>
<p>The fission process is just like alpha decay in that the
nucleus breaks up into two fragments. The main difference
between these processes is in the relative weights of the fragments.
In the alpha decay of U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312;, for instance, one fragment
has a weight of four and the other 234. In the fission process
the fragments tend to be more nearly equal in weight. For
example, one may weigh 90 and the other 148.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> Other weight
combinations are also possible.</p>
<p>The explanation of spontaneous fission is in essence the
same as that of alpha decay. Spontaneous fission, however, is a
less probable process because the two fragments are more
strongly bound to each other by the nuclear forces than they
are in alpha decay. More energy must be borrowed, and it
must be borrowed for a longer term in order to penetrate the
energy barrier.</p>
<p>The relative likelihoods of spontaneous fission and alpha
decay can be appreciated from the following fact. In one hour
in a gram of U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312; there occur about 45 million alpha decays
but only about 25 spontaneous fissions.</p>
<p>Once the energy barrier has been overcome, the energy released
in alpha decay or spontaneous fission is proportional to
the charges on the two fragments. For alpha decay, the product
of the charges is 2 &times; 90 = 180; for spontaneous fission,
this product will typically be about 40 &times; 52 = 2,080. Hence
one might expect the fission energy release to be 10 to 15
times greater than the alpha energy release. As a matter of
fact the fission energy release is even greater than this estimate
indicates, being about 30 to 50 times greater than the
alpha energy release. That so large an amount of energy is released,
is a very important feature of the fission process from
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
the point of view of practical utilization of atomic energy.</p>
<p>Being at the end of the periodic system, uranium requires
a large ratio of neutrons to protons for its greatest stability.
The fission fragments, however, lie in the middle of the system
of elements, requiring a much smaller ratio of neutrons
to protons for stability. This has two consequences.</p>
<p>One is that the fragments themselves may be expected to be
unstable. They will undergo beta decay (electron emission)
several times consecutively before a stable combination of
neutrons and protons is reached. This radioactivity of the fission
products constitutes a potential hazard in any practical
application of fission atomic energy. In later chapters of this
book we shall consider particularly the possible hazard from
the fallout of radioactive fission products created in atomic
explosions, and also the hazard associated with the operation
and maintenance of atomic reactors.</p>
<p>The second consequence of the neutron excess is that neutrons
may boil off from the fragments immediately after the
fission process has occurred. This can happen because a lot of
disorderly internal motion is generated by the fission process
within the fragments, and these fragments do not have a particularly
strong hold on their neutrons. The practical value
of the released neutrons is something we shall discuss at
length in a later chapter. For the present we mention only
that these neutrons provide the mechanism whereby a chain
reaction is made possible.</p>
<p>Spontaneous fission and alpha decay are responsible for the
fact that elements with charge greater than 92 are not found
in nature. There is little doubt that these elements were
made in the beginning. But they have long since decayed.</p>
<p>An interesting case of spontaneous nuclear fission is californium&sup2;&#8309;&#8308;
(charge 98), with a half-life of 55 days. This isotope
is formed in large quantities in certain stellar explosions
called super-novae. Once in a millennium one of a collection
of a billion stars flares into incredible brilliance. For a few
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
weeks this single star shines with the combined energy and
luster of a billion ordinary stars&mdash;then it fades away gradually.
Such a &ldquo;new&rdquo; star (nova), with the greatest power of radiation,
is called a &ldquo;super-nova.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We believe that many nuclear reactions take place in a super-nova.
It has been observed that a few weeks after the initial
outburst of light, the intensity of light is reduced almost
exactly by a factor of two every 55 days for a year or so. This
is precisely what would be expected if the energy generated
in the star during this time were due to the spontaneous fission
of californium&sup2;&#8309;&#8308;. Here we see a model of what happens
to naturally radioactive elements. Of these we have retained
on earth only the ones with the longest half-lives, like uranium,
thorium, and potassium.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />Reactions Between Nuclei</h2>
<p>The alchemists tried to transform one element
into another artificially. They used heat, they used chemicals;
they even used witchcraft. They failed. Their simplest
method&mdash;to heat the substance in order to transform it&mdash;was
really correct. The trouble was that their temperatures were
too low by a factor of more than 10,000. What is needed, is a
temperature of the order of tens of millions of degrees.</p>
<p>At such high temperatures two nuclei may occasionally approach
each other in spite of the electrical repulsion between
them. Sometimes they may even get close enough to each
other to undergo a nuclear reaction. This, of course, happens
with least difficulty if the nuclear charge is small. Hydrogen
nuclei, which carry charge 1, participate in such reactions
most easily.</p>
<p>In the interior of stars temperatures range from about 10 to
100 million degrees, and nuclear reactions do occur. The reaction
responsible for the production of energy in the stars is:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">4H&sup1; &rarr; He&#8308; + energy</p>
</div>
<p>Four protons combine to make an alpha particle with a release
of energy. Actually this reaction does not take place all
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
at once but several steps are required. That energy should
be released, one expects from the fact that the alpha particle
is very stable. Any process in which light nuclei combine to
form a heavier nucleus with a release of energy is known as
&ldquo;fusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The particular fusion process that goes on in the stars releases
its energy in many forms: as positrons, neutrinos, electromagnetic
radiation, and motion of the reacting particles.
The positrons also carry off the excess charge of the reaction.</p>
<p>The neutrinos fly through the star without interacting,
carrying their energy away into outer space, probably never
again to make contact with the material universe. The remainder
of the fusion energy is deposited within the star&rsquo;s
interior, which is thus kept hot enough so that the fusion reaction
can keep going. The name &ldquo;thermonuclear&rdquo; is appropriately
applied to this type of reaction.</p>
<p>A lot of effort and imagination is being devoted to the
problem of making a controlled thermonuclear reaction. The
motivation for this project comes from the fact that good
thermonuclear fuels, such as deuterium (H&sup2;), are abundant
and cheap. There is enough deuterium in the oceans of the
world to supply man&rsquo;s energy needs for many millions of
years. One difficulty, of course, is to find a container for the
reaction.</p>
<p>Even under stellar conditions the rate of fusion reactions is
not very great. It takes approximately a billion years for only
one per cent of the nuclei to react. Consequently even higher
temperatures than those found in stars are required to produce
large amounts of energy in a short time. But no known
materials can withstand temperatures of more than a few
thousand degrees centigrade. One idea is to keep the &ldquo;burning&rdquo;
fuel away from material walls by means of magnetic
fields.</p>
<p>Is there a way to make nuclei react without the extreme
temperatures needed in the thermonuclear reactions? What
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
one is really trying to do is bring two nuclear particles into
intimate enough contact so that the nuclear forces can act between
them. There is no reason why one should not use a
<i>cold</i> target material, which is bombarded from the outside by
energetic nuclear projectiles, for example protons or alpha
particles. The projectiles, if they are energetic enough, can
overcome the electrical repulsion of the target nuclei, and
they actually can penetrate. The resulting &ldquo;compound&rdquo; nuclei
would either be unstable and disintegrate instantaneously,
or else be almost stable (i.e., radioactive) and disintegrate
after some period of time. In either case nuclei of new
elements would probably be formed in the reaction. This procedure
sounds simple, but it has its difficulties.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="298" />
<p class="pcap">Interior of the sun. The thermonuclear reactions take place
mainly in the very hot, very dense central region (shaded). This
region is about 20,000 miles in radius and has a density approximately
80 times the density of water.</p>
</div>
<p>The main difficulty is that the nucleus is a very tiny target.
Its area is about 100 million times smaller than the area of the
atom as a whole. If a piece of matter is bombarded by an energetic
particle, chance alone will determine whether the particle
is directed toward a nucleus. To be sure, if the particle
misses the nucleus of one atom, it still has the opportunity of
hitting the nuclei of other atoms which may lie in its path. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
does not have many such opportunities, however, because, being
charged, it constantly interacts with the atomic electrons,
which gradually absorb energy causing the particle to slow
down.</p>
<p>As the particle slows down, its chance of hitting a nucleus
decreases, even if it is heading directly toward one, because of
the repulsion between its charge and that of the nucleus. Unless
the particle has sufficient speed, it cannot overcome this
repulsion.</p>
<p>Charged particles may be given the required speeds by accelerating
them through large electric fields. If a unit charge
is accelerated through a potential difference of one volt, it
acquires an energy of one <i>electron-volt</i>. The energies required
for nuclear bombardment are of the order of several
million electron-volts, which can be provided by atom-smashing
machines such as the cyclotron.</p>
<p>Even at such high energies very few of the nuclear projectiles
actually find their way to a target nucleus. Most of them
are slowed down by the electrons, wasting their energy in
heating up the target material. Perhaps one particle out of a
million will be lucky enough to induce a nuclear reaction.</p>
<p>If the purpose of the nuclear accelerating machines were to
produce cheap energy, they would not be of much value. A
nuclear reaction may typically release five to 20 million electron-volts
of energy. But to obtain this reaction, a million
particles had to be accelerated to energies of several million
electron-volts. The recoverable and useable energy will be
only a minute fraction of the total invested.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as a tool for scientific discovery, the
atom-smashers have been of great importance. That one event
in a million has given us much of our knowledge of nuclear
physics.</p>
<p>The achievement of nuclear reactions by particle bombardment
did not actually wait on the invention of man-made accelerating
machines. Energetic alpha particles are available
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
from the radioactive decay of heavy elements. In 1919 Ernest
Rutherford used such radioactive elements as a source of
alpha particles. The alpha particles were made to bombard
ordinary nitrogen, causing the reaction:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="c">He&#8308; </td><td class="c">+ </td><td class="c">N&sup1;&#8308; </td><td class="c">&rarr; </td><td class="c">O&sup1;&#8311; </td><td class="l">+ proton</td></tr>

<tr><td class="c">(2 neutrons) </td><td class="c"> </td><td class="c">(7 neutrons) </td><td class="c"> </td><td class="c">(9 neutrons)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>That is, an alpha particle plus a nitrogen&sup1;&#8308; nucleus react to
produce a nucleus of (stable) oxygen&sup1;&#8311; plus a proton. Oxygen&sup1;&#8311;
is a nucleus with 8 protons and 9 neutrons. The ordinary
abundant form of oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. Natural
oxygen contains a small amount of oxygen&sup1;&#8311;.</p>
<p>Later, in 1934, Irene Curie Joliot (the daughter of the discoverer
of radium, Madame Curie) and her husband, Frederic
Joliot, used naturally available alpha particles to make artificial
radioactive nuclei for the first time. The reaction was:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="c">He&#8308; </td><td class="c">+ </td><td class="c">aluminum&sup2;&#8311; </td><td class="c">&rarr; </td><td class="c">phosphorus&sup3;&#8304; </td><td class="l">+ neutron</td></tr>

<tr><td class="c">(2 neutrons) </td><td class="c"> </td><td class="c">(14 neutrons) </td><td class="c"> </td><td class="c">(15 neutrons)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Phosphorus&sup3;&#8304; is an unstable nucleus and emits a beta ray (a
positron) to become silicon&sup3;&#8304; (which is stable). The half-life
for this decay is about 2.5 minutes. The Joliots&rsquo; reaction was
the first instance in which man had produced radioactivity
and known it. Actually cyclotrons had been producing radioactivity
in good abundance for the preceding two years&mdash;but
physicists had been unaware of this fact.</p>
<p>It is amusing that nature has also provided us with an
atom-smashing machine and indeed one that produces far
greater energies than any apparatus yet devised by man. This
machine operates on the principle of fluctuating, turbulent
magnetic fields in interstellar space. Cosmic particles&mdash;mainly
protons, but also some alpha particles and even heavier
nuclei&mdash;are accelerated by these changing magnetic fields
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
and hurled occasionally into the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. The energies
of these cosmic particles are enormous, ranging from
billions of electron-volts to values a million times higher.</p>
<p>When a cosmic particle gets inside the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere,
it does not go far before colliding with a nucleus of nitrogen
or oxygen. Out of this nuclear event emerge all the fundamental
particles mentioned so far, and some others known as
mesons. Mesons are particles which may be charged or neutral,
and which have a weight a few hundred times that of the
electron. Some of these particles are believed to be connected
with the forces that hold the nucleus together.</p>
<p>The nuclear debris from the collision will itself be very
energetic and will further disrupt other nitrogen and oxygen
nuclei. There soon develops a cascade of electrons, positrons,
mesons, neutrons, protons, and electromagnetic radiation
moving toward the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>About once a second every square inch of the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere
receives such an energetic particle from outer space.
The cascade that results carries penetrating radiations to the
surface of the earth. All living organisms are constantly subjected
to this radiation background. It is an important fact
that the intensity of this radiation is reduced in its passage
through the air, and inhabitants of Denver or Lima receive
more cosmic radiation than the inhabitants of Los Angeles or
New York.</p>
<p>Some neutrons made by collisions of the primary cosmic
particles in the atmosphere may collide with nuclei of nitrogen.
When this happens, the following reaction occurs:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="c">nitrogen&sup1;&#8308; </td><td class="c">+ neutron &rarr; </td><td class="c">carbon&sup1;&#8308; </td><td class="c">+ proton</td></tr>

</table>
<p>Carbon&sup1;&#8308; is a radioactive electron emitter with a half-life of
5,600 years. This half-life is long enough so that much of the
carbon&sup1;&#8308; in the world today was probably made ten to twenty
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
thousand years ago. Willard Libby studied this process in
a careful and quantitative way, traced the history of the
radioactive carbon from the atmosphere into living beings,
and, by measuring the carbon&sup1;&#8308; content in historical remains,
opened up a whole new branch of archeology.</p>
<p>Living organisms breathe in carbon (in the form of carbon
dioxide) from the air. Most of this carbon is ordinary stable
carbon&sup1;&sup2;; a tiny fraction is radioactive carbon&sup1;&#8308;. The organism
is unable to distinguish between the two isotopes, and
takes in carbon&sup1;&#8308; in the same ratio to carbon&sup1;&sup2; as exists in the
atmosphere. This ratio persists throughout the organism&rsquo;s
lifetime, but when the organism dies and no more carbon is
assimilated, the ratio begins to decrease as the carbon&sup1;&#8308; nuclei
gradually disintegrate. By observing the ratio of carbon&sup1;&#8308; to
carbon&sup1;&sup2; in fossil remains and other archeological objects, the
date at which death occurred can be calculated. In this way
the age of ancient Egyptian mummies has been found, and it
has been shown that some sequoia wood is more than 1,500
years old. By measuring the carbon&sup1;&#8308; in trees that were killed
by the last advance of glaciation, and looking into other remains
of life from the last ice age, it has been possible to show
that this last ice age occurred only 10,000 years ago&mdash;instead
of 20,000 years, as had been previously believed. Carbon&sup1;&#8308;-dating
has therefore thoroughly revised our ideas about the
rapidity with which the empires known to history have
emerged from the most primitive conditions. A crucial part
of the argument is that isotopes of the same element are
chemically indistinguishable.</p>
<p>An alternative reaction which may occur when neutrons
strike nitrogen, is</p>

<p>H&sup3;, triton, is also radioactive, undergoing a beta decay to
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
become He&sup3; (2 protons and 1 neutron) with a half-life of
12.25 years. Tritons too can be used for dating old objects&mdash;for
example, old wine. The water in the wine cannot be replenished
with cosmic-ray tritons after the wine has been
bottled. Thus fifty per cent of the tritons disappear every
12.25 years.</p>
<p>We have here two examples of nuclear reactions induced
by neutron bombardment. Recalling the disadvantages of
charged particles as nuclear projectiles for alchemists, it must
surely seem that neutrons would be ideal for this purpose.
Being chargeless, they are neither electrically repelled by the
nuclei nor constantly slowed down by energy-losing collisions
with the electrons. The fate of almost every neutron
moving in a large piece of matter is eventual collision with
a nucleus.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> Neutrons are ideal nuclear projectiles, except for
one thing: they are hard to get.</p>
<p>Protons and alpha particles are found abundantly in nature
as the nuclei of hydrogen and helium atoms. Neutrons,
however, are not found in nature, and in the past have been
made in nuclear reactions that were themselves initiated by
charged particles. For example,</p>

<p>But now we encounter again the difficulty associated with
charged particles. Only one alpha particle in a million undergoes
a nuclear reaction to produce a neutron. The neutron,
of course, makes a nuclear reaction every time. Over-all,
then, we obtain two nuclear reactions per million nuclear
projectiles, instead of one per million. With such methods
we are not so much better off than the old alchemists. A
cheap and plentiful source of neutrons would, however, put
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
the alchemist in business. In this way one could make rare
elements and radioactive isotopes, and what is more important,
he would be able to utilize concentrated nuclear energy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />Fission and the Chain Reaction</h2>
<p>Neutrons are ideal projectiles for nuclear
bombardment because they carry no charge, can approach
nuclei easily, and interact with them strongly. These neutral
particles, discovered by James Chadwick in 1932, were used
soon afterward by Enrico Fermi and his collaborators to
bombard most of the elements of the periodic table. Very
often in these experiments a nucleus would capture a neutron
and become unstable with too much weight for its
charge. Stability would then be restored by a beta decay,
leaving the nucleus with one more unit of charge than it had
to begin with. In 1934 Fermi tried this experiment with
uranium, charge 92, the most highly charged element known
at that time. He hoped to make a transuranic element with
charge 93.</p>
<p>Throughout the experiments the uranium was observed
with radioactive counters and found to become far more
radioactive than uranium ordinarily is in its natural state.
There was no way to account for all this radioactivity except
to assume that new elements had been formed in the process
of neutron bombardment. A chemical analysis revealed no
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
elements with charges between 86 and 91. From this evidence
Fermi concluded that no elements of charge less than 92 had
been made and therefore the radioactivity must be due to
charges greater than 92. He concluded that transuranic elements
had been made in the laboratory.</p>
<p>Neither Fermi nor anyone else, however, was happy with
this conclusion. There was far too great a variety of radioactivity
for comfort. It had to be assumed that not only was
the element with charge 93 being made, but also elements
with charges 94, 95, and many more. This was very hard to
understand. Ida Noddack,<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> a chemist, published a paper proposing
an alternative explanation of the experiment: that a
nucleus of uranium, when it captures a neutron, might break
up into two fragments that could have any of various weights
and charges. In other words, she suggested that Fermi had
produced nuclear fission.</p>
<p>Fermi, however, believed that the fission process was an
impossibility. He had a convincing proof, based on the measured
values of the weights of nuclei and the formula of Einstein,
E = mc&sup2;. From this formula Fermi calculated the energy
liberated when uranium breaks into two pieces; then
he took into account the energy of electric repulsion between
the pieces and found that the energy barrier was so large that
the fission process could not take place. This proof was absolutely
correct. The only trouble was that the measured values
of the weights of nuclei happened to be inaccurate at that
time!</p>
<p>But for this accident, fission would have been discovered
in 1934 instead of 1938. If it had been, Nazi Germany might
easily have been the first country to make the atomic bomb.
At that time some German scientists were active in the field
of military applications. The American physicists had not yet
turned much attention to the subject.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>An important feature of Fermi&rsquo;s experiment is the large
amount and variety of radioactivity that he found. The reason
for this variety, as we now know, is that the fission process
does not take place in a unique manner. The two primary
fission fragments are very rarely of equal weight and charge.
On the average the lighter fragment weighs about 90, and
the heavier one about 140. Sometimes the lighter fragment
will weigh as little as 75, and the heavier one as much as 160.
As the weight varies, of course, so also does the charge. The
charge of the lighter fragment averages 38, which is strontium,
and the heavier one 54, which is xenon. All in all there
are more than a hundred different species of nuclei represented
among the primary fission fragments.</p>
<p>Practically all of these nuclei are radioactive and undergo
three or four disintegrations before reaching stability. Overall
therefore, several hundred distinct radioactive species are
created by the fission process in uranium. Elements with
charges 43 and 61 (which are not found in nature) have been
identified as fission products in fairly appreciable quantities.
Most of the fission products are short-lived electron and
gamma emitters that can contribute only to the local and
immediate radioactive hazard. Two of the long-lived products
are abundant and important. These are cesium&sup1;&sup3;&#8311; and
strontium&#8313;&#8304;.</p>
<p>Cesium&sup1;&sup3;&#8311; has a half-life of 30 years and emits a gamma
ray with an energy of 0.6 million electron-volts. Strontium&#8313;&#8304;
has a half-life of 28 years and emits an electron with an average
energy of 0.22 million electron-volts. The daughter
nucleus in this process is yttrium&#8313;&#8304;, which emits another
electron with an average energy of one million electron-volts.
The half-life of yttrium&#8313;&#8304; is 64 hours. In effect, therefore,
strontium&#8313;&#8304; emits two electrons, each with an average energy
of 0.6 million electron-volts. For the long-term radioactive
hazard, particularly the world-wide fallout associated with
atomic explosions, the two isotopes cesium&sup1;&sup3;&#8311; and strontium&#8313;&#8304;
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
are the most significant. Strontium&#8313;&#8304; is the more dangerous
to living organisms because it is deposited in the bones and
retained in the body for long periods.</p>
<p>Besides radioactivity there is another feature of the fission
process which is so conspicuous that it may seem hard to
understand how Fermi failed to notice it&mdash;namely the large
amount of energy released. The fission of a single nucleus of
uranium releases an energy of 200 million electron-volts as
contrasted with ordinary radioactive decay energies of 5 to
10 million electron-volts. (The energy released from the
burning of one atom of coal is only 4 electron-volts.)</p>
<p>Of the 200 million electron-volts released in fission, about
10 million go into gamma rays and neutrons created in the
fission process itself. This energy contributes to the immediate
and local radiation danger. Another 24 million electron-volts
go into radioactivity of the fission products, and of this,
about half go into neutrinos, which are neither dangerous
nor useful; the other half is carried by electrons and gives
rise to the delayed radioactive hazard. But the bulk of the
energy, over 160 million electron-volts, goes into kinetic
energy of the two primary fission fragments. Of this amount,
100 million, on the average, go to the lighter fragment.</p>
<p>One hundred million electron-volt fission fragments should
certainly have been noticed by Fermi&rsquo;s radioactive counters&mdash;if
they had been able to reach the counters. The fragments
were not able to reach the counters, however. The reason is
that Fermi was a careful worker. He knew that his sample
of uranium would emit some radioactive particles even before
neutron bombardment. This natural radioactivity he
did not want to get mixed up with the radioactivity that
would be produced in the experiment. So he put an absorbing
foil between the uranium sample and the radioactive
counters. The fission fragments could not get through the
foil.</p>
<p>It is amusing that shortly afterward another noted physicist
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
repeated Fermi&rsquo;s experiment, but this time without the
foil. He reported that he was unable to get any significant
results because his counter, for reasons unknown, started to
spark.</p>
<p>Thus fission remained a secret. But in England Leo Szilard
obtained patent papers on the nuclear chain reaction. He
pointed out that in some nuclear reactions free neutrons
might be released. These neutrons might then succeed in
producing further reactions which would produce more neutrons.
Provided that at least one neutron made in each reaction
were able to induce a reaction in another nucleus, a
chain reaction would take place.</p>
<p>The main problem, of course, was to avoid excessive neutron
losses. There are two ways in which the losses mainly
occur. One is by wasteful, nonreproductive capture in the
nuclei; the other, by neutron leakage from the material surface.
This second loss, Szilard showed, could be minimized
by using a sufficiently large amount of chain-reacting material.</p>
<p>The point is that a neutron born in a nuclear reaction must
travel on the average a certain distance before it can produce
another reaction. If the size of the chain-reacting material is
much less than this distance, practically all of the neutrons
produced will be able to escape through the material surface,
and no chain reaction will be possible. If the size of the
material is large compared to this distance, the leakage loss
becomes negligible, and the possibility of a chain reaction
depends entirely on the magnitude of the first kind of loss,
the wasteful captures in nuclei. If this loss is not too great,
and a chain reaction is possible, there will be a <i>critical</i> size
of the material at which on the average exactly one neutron
per reaction will be able to induce another reaction. A just
critical chain reaction of this kind is what is needed for an
atomic reactor.</p>
<p>If the size of the material is greater than the critical size,
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
on the average more than one neutron per reaction will cause
another reaction and the chain reaction will run away. If,
for example, two neutrons can cause another reaction, there
will be two neutrons after the first generation, four after the
second, eight after the third, and so forth. This is the principle
of the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>After about 80 generations, an appreciable fraction of all
the nuclei in the material will have undergone a nuclear
transformation and so much energy will have been released
that the material will not stay together even for the short
time needed to produce the next generation. The whole
material begins to fly apart, the system becomes sub-critical,
and the chain reaction stops. The entire process lasts only a
fraction of a microsecond.</p>
<p>Thus even before fission was discovered, Szilard laid the
basis for constructing the atomic bomb and the nuclear chain
reactor. As materials in which a chain reaction might conceivably
be made to occur he named thorium, uranium and
beryllium. On beryllium he was wrong because the mass of
this atom was incorrectly known. On thorium, his guess was
good. On uranium, he hit the bull&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>Finally in December 1938 the secret broke. Hahn and
Strassmann in Germany made a chemical analysis of a uranium
target that had been exposed to neutrons. They were
far more thorough than previous investigators had been, and
they found barium, charge 56, which had not been present
in the target material before the experiment. The only possible
explanation was the fission process. Within a few weeks
the violent kicks caused by the fission products in counters
were found, and in the following days this experiment was
repeated around the world.</p>
<p>There was no doubt that neutrons could induce fission
in uranium nuclei. A few more weeks, and it was ascertained
that the fission process released neutrons which might lead
to more fissions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>The chain reaction, however, was still far from a reality.
Niels Bohr and John Wheeler proved that a neutron could
not cause fission in U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312; unless its energy were greater than
about one million electron-volts. When the neutrons are first
made in the fission process, many of them do have energies
greater than one million electron-volts. But before they can
cause a fission, they usually make a few nonfission collisions
with uranium nuclei, giving part of their energy to the nuclei
and escaping with the remainder. The nuclei are then
left with too little energy to undergo fission and the neutrons
with too little energy to cause fissions in their next
encounters. Thus too few neutrons reproduce themselves and
no chain is possible.</p>
<p>Bohr and Wheeler suggested, however, that the rare isotope
of uranium, U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309;, can undergo fission when any neutron,
even a slow neutron, hits it. Thus a chain reaction is
possible in U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309;. This was confirmed experimentally shortly
afterwards by John Dunning and Alfred Drier and their co-workers
at Columbia University.</p>
<p>Why the isotopes 235 and 238 behave so differently, is not
difficult to understand. The 235 is more explosive and more
prone to undergo fission than 238 because it is smaller and
therefore its protons repel each other more strongly. More
important still, when a neutron is captured by 235, it acquires
a greater kinetic energy by virtue of the short-range
nuclear attraction than a neutron acquires when it is captured
by 238. This happens for the simple reason that nuclei
tend to be more stable when they have an even number of
neutrons (or protons) than when they have an odd number.
U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309;, having an odd number of neutrons, is more eager to
receive an additional neutron than 238, which already has
an even number of neutrons. Consequently, the capture of a
slow neutron by 235 almost always eventuates in the fission
process; while in 238, the excess energy, introduced by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
neutron, is merely ejected from the nucleus in the form of
a gamma ray, and U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312; becomes U&sup2;&sup3;&#8313;.</p>
<p>A chain reaction is possible in U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309; , but it is necessary to
separate this rare isotope from the abundant U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312;. The separation
process is anything but simple since isotopes of the
same element are chemically indistinguishable. Even the
weight difference in this case, is little more than one per
cent. Bohr rejected the idea of a large-scale separation with
the remark: &ldquo;You would have to turn the whole country into
a factory.&rdquo; Of course it is now a matter of history that the
job was actually done under the Manhattan project during
World War II. During the war Bohr (alias Nicholas Baker)
again visited the United States and was shown the separation
plants. He said: &ldquo;You see I was right. You <i>did</i> turn the country
into a factory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Natural uranium contains U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309; in the ratio of 1 part to
139 of U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312;. It was hoped at first that this concentration would
be sufficient to make a chain reaction, and that the expensive
enrichment processes could be avoided. This seemed possible
because at energies of a fraction of an electron-volt the neutrons
are much more easily caught by U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309; than by U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312;,
which compensates for the low concentration. Actually neutrons
are slowed down until their energy is as low as the energy
of all other particles participating in the general agitation
caused by the temperature. This energy is low enough
for the purpose.</p>
<p>However, the neutrons are made in the fission process with
an energy of about a million electron-volts. Before they slow
down sufficiently, they must pass through a stage in which
their energy is about 7 electron-volts. In the neighborhood
of this energy, it happens that the U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312; has an extremely high
probability for capturing a neutron and changing into U&sup2;&sup3;&#8313;.
Near some other energies, similar though smaller absorption
hurdles must be passed. Therefore natural uranium by itself
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
cannot be used to make a chain reaction. In 1940, Fermi and
Szilard, working now in the United States, found a way
around this difficulty.</p>
<p>Their trick was to mix the natural uranium with a material
whose nuclei are so lightweight that they suffer a big
recoil when struck by a neutron and thus absorb a large
fraction of the neutron energy. The neutron is thus <i>moderated</i>
down to a low energy, rapidly and in big energy jumps,
so that either it does not spend much time at the unfavorable
energies where it can be caught by U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312; or else it misses these
energies altogether. By imbedding the uranium in lumps in
the moderating material instead of making a homogeneous
mixture of the two, the absorption can be circumvented even
better.</p>
<p>For the purpose of making a <i>controlled</i> chain reaction, one
may use the method of enrichment, or the method of moderation,
or both. But to produce a <i>violent</i> chain reaction, an
atomic bomb, only the enrichment method will work. The
reason is that all the energy of the bomb must be generated
in a time that is as short as the time it takes the bomb to fly
apart, which is a fraction of a microsecond. If natural uranium
were used, the reaction would be slow and sluggish
and would be extinguished before a substantial fraction of
the nuclei could have reacted.</p>
<p>It is interesting to consider that chain-reacting substances
could have been obtained easily six billion years ago, before
the U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312; had time to decay and become a rare isotope. (The
U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309; was then about as abundant as U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312;.) A chemical separation
would still have been necessary and so we do not need
to imagine that chain-reacting mixtures accumulated spontaneously
on the young earth.</p>
<p>On the other hand, six billion years from now U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309; will
have become so rare that it will be impossible to get a reactor
going by moderation. At the same time the isotope separation
will have become most expensive since the isotope to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
separated will be present in an abundance of less than 100
parts in a million. For those who like to worry about the
distant future we should hasten to add that other methods
of obtaining atomic energy will remain possible. And in any
case there is good reason to believe that some stellar explosions
produce fresh supplies of U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309; which space merchants
could undoubtedly make available.</p>
<p>As to our present terrestrial supplies: uranium, like other
heavy elements, is quite rare. But the earth is divided into
layers of which the topmost 10 miles, forming something of
a slag or scum, contain quite a few rare compounds. In particular
almost all of the uranium in our planet is conveniently
collected right under our feet, for us to use as we see
fit.</p>

<br />Action of Radiation on Matter</h2>
<p>When an energetic particle moves through
matter (living or nonliving), what happens is a question of
chemistry. Chemistry is the subject that deals with the arrangement
and rearrangement of electrons in atoms and
molecules. A chemical rearrangement generally requires an
energy in the neighborhood of a few electron-volts. (As we
have seen, an electron-volt is the energy released when an
electron moves through a potential of one volt, i.e., a little
less than one per cent of the driving force in a standard
electric outlet.) An energetic particle, such as might be
emitted in a radioactive decay, typically has an energy of a
few million electron-volts. Thus a single such particle has
the potentiality of about a million chemical rearrangements.</p>
<p>Energetic particles may be charged or neutral, light or
heavy, or electromagnetic in nature. Because of this diversity
one might think there would be no common grounds for
comparing the action on matter of different particles. Each
particle might conceivably make its own inimitable variety
of chemical rearrangements. Actually this is not the case.</p>
<p>Unlike some chemical poisons, which seek out specific
molecules in our body, the energetic particles strike at whatever
atoms or molecules happen to get in their way. They
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
act, in this sense, like a sledge hammer. Their effects can be
measured directly from the strength (or energy) of the blow.
Which particle delivers the blow is of little consequence
provided the same amount of energy is delivered and provided
the same tissues are affected (in the case of living matter).
After the blow, however, some specific chemical effects
may occur. When water or some other molecule in the body
is broken up by radiation, the fragments produced may
themselves be chemical poisons and attack the biologically
important large molecules in a secondary way. In fact, it
seems probable that a considerable part of the radiation damage
caused in living systems, both healthwise and genetically,
occurs in this manner.</p>
<p>Although the energetic particles are all similar in their
ultimate action on matter, namely in producing wholesale
destruction of atoms and molecules, they differ somewhat in
the way in which they bring about this destruction. Charged
particles act in one way, gamma rays in another, and neutrons
in still another. It is simplest to begin our discussion
with the charged particles.</p>
<p>The most important charged particles are those connected
with the natural background of radioactivity and cosmic rays,
and the fission process. These include alpha rays, beta rays,
mesons, and fission fragments. For review, a table of the
weights and charges of these particles, as well as a few others,
is shown. As usual, we have used the weight and charge of
the proton as units.</p>

<tr><td class="l">average heavy fission fragment </td><td class="c">138 </td><td class="c">22</td></tr>
</table>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>If the fission fragments were completely stripped of their
orbital electrons, they would have charges even greater than
the values indicated in the table. The reader will recall that
the average charge of the nucleus of the light fission fragment
is 38, and of the heavy, 54. But such highly positively charged
particles exert an enormous attraction on electrons. Some
of these remain attached even during the fission process itself.
As the fission products lose their speed during passage
through matter, they pick up more electrons and gradually
lose their charge.</p>
<p>When any of these energetic charged particles moves
through matter, it interacts with electrons in the atoms. As
a result of this interaction, the electrons may be dislodged
from their usual states of motion. If the interaction is gentle&mdash;either
because the charged particle passes the atom at a
considerable distance or else because the particle is moving
so rapidly that the interaction lasts for only a short time&mdash;the
electron may be left undisturbed. If the interaction is
more violent, however, the electron may be excited to a more
energetic state of motion while still remaining in the same
atom or molecule; or it may actually be ejected, ending up
at some other atomic site. In this latter event the original
atom is left with a residual positive charge and is said to be
<i>ionized</i>. At the same time the displaced electron is apt to
unite with whatever atom or molecule happens to be nearby,
creating in this way a negative ion. The whole process may
be described as forming an ion pair. In the wake of the
charged particle one finds, therefore, ionized and excited
atoms and molecules. A rearrangement of atoms will now
ensue which leads to new chemical compounds. The important
thing for us is, however, that these chemical changes do
not depend very much on the type of particle which produced
the ionization; the proportion between ionization,
excitation, and eventual chemical reaction remains more or
less the same. Roughly speaking, the more ion pairs that are
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
formed in living cells, the greater is the extent of biological
damage.</p>
<p>To make an ion pair requires the expenditure of a certain
amount of energy. It might seem as though this amount
should depend crucially on the weight, charge, and energy
of the particle, and also on the medium through which the
particle is moving. This is not so. There is some dependence,
of course, but only slight. Any charged particle, irrespective
of its energy, moving in any medium&mdash;air, water, soil, or
living tissue&mdash;creates ion pairs at the rate of about one per
32 electron-volts. A one-million-electron-volt particle produces
about 30,000 ion pairs before losing all of its energy.
(When it does lose its energy, if it is a positively charged
particle, it will pick up enough electrons to become neutral.
An alpha particle, for example, will become an ordinary helium
atom; a proton will become an atom of hydrogen.)</p>
<p>We have said that two charged particles having the same
energy, produce the same total number of ionizations. There
is an important respect, however, in which charged particles
of the same energy may differ. That is, in the density of ionization
along their paths. In particular, the more slowly the
particle is moving and the greater its charge, the more ionization
and damage it will produce in a given distance. At the
same time it will lose energy at a greater rate. If we compare
two charged particles of the same energy plowing into matter,
the one which leaves the deeper furrow will be stopped
more quickly.</p>
<p>For a greater charge it is easy to understand that the electrical
interaction is increased and hence each atomic electron
is more strongly disturbed. If, on the other hand, the particle
moves more slowly (which is usually the case if it is
heavy) it spends a longer time in the neighborhood of the
atomic electrons. The electrical interaction thus has a longer
duration and is more effective in ejecting an electron. For
this same reason the density of ionization along the path of
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
a particular charged particle should tend to become greater
and greater as the particle slows down. Actually this tendency
is opposed in the case of a fission fragment by the increased
likelihood of the particle&rsquo;s picking up electrons and reducing
its charge. As a result, the ionization density for these fragments
is rather uniform. If a heavily charged, slow particle
moves through matter it leaves so many disturbed and disrupted
molecules behind that now these molecules may react
with each other. Therefore heavy ionization may lead to
peculiar effects. Nevertheless all ionizing particles give rise
to roughly similar chemical change and destruction.</p>
<p>Except for the beta rays, all the charged particles are very
heavy compared to the electron. Consequently, as they move
through matter and interact with the atomic electrons, their
paths are not perceptibly deflected from the original direction.
The beta rays, on the other hand, having the same
weight as the atomic electrons, are appreciably affected by
their encounters and are frequently forced to change direction.
Their paths are thus winding and random.</p>
<p>Because the beta ray does not travel in a straight line, its
ability to penetrate matter must not be measured by its total
path length. As a rule of thumb, the <i>range</i> of a beta particle,
being the distance it travels along the line of its original
direction, is about one half of its total path length. For heavier
charged particles, however, no distinction need be made
between range and actual distance traveled.</p>
<p>The most important fact about the ranges of charged particles
is that they are small. An alpha particle, for instance,
with a typical radioactive energy of a few million electron-volts,
has a range in water (or living tissue) of a few thousandths
of an inch. Such a particle could not penetrate a
sheet of paper. A fission fragment, despite its great energy, is
even less penetrating than the alpha particle. The proton has
a somewhat greater range than the alpha particle. But the
beta ray, because of its low weight, has by far the greatest
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
range of any of the charged particles. Even it, however, goes
only a fraction of an inch in solid or liquid materials.</p>
<p>The following table shows the ranges (in inches) of some
of the charged particles in air and water as a function of
energy (in millions of electron-volts):</p>

</table>
<p>The table shows that charged particles travel only short
distances in matter. For this reason these particles are not a
serious external radiation hazard. The protons and the alpha
rays are usually stopped by less than a foot of air. Ordinary
clothing or even the outer layer of our skin (which is composed
of nonliving cells) will stop them completely.</p>
<p>Beta rays are stopped by less than seventy feet of air or an
inch or less of solid material. (Actually most of the beta rays
produced in the fission process have energies less than a million
electron-volts or so, and hence their ranges are even
smaller.) Radioactive contamination of beta emitters directly
on one&rsquo;s clothes or body could cause trouble; but a good
scrubbing soon after exposure will eliminate this problem.
The interior of a house or building should be quite safe from
any outside source of charged particles emitted by radioactive
substances except possibly the most energetic beta rays. Only
if the source of charged particles is inside the body so that in
spite of their limited ranges the particles can find their way
to sensitive tissues, is there any danger. In this case, as we
shall see in a later chapter, the danger may be considerable.</p>
<p>Charged particles of one type stand pretty much by themselves.
These are the mesons found in cosmic rays. These particles
move as fast as energetic beta rays and, like the beta
rays, carry unit charge. Their biological effects are therefore
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
the same as the biological effects of beta radiation, with one
important difference. The cosmic ray mesons carry much
more energy and therefore have a much greater range.
Whereas the beta rays are stopped in the skin, the mesons
can cause damage throughout the entire body. The mesons
produce the same effects as a substance which emits beta radiation
uniformly in the whole body. This fact is important. It
puts us in the position to compare effects of man-made radioactivity
with effects of the cosmic rays to which we are constantly
exposed.</p>
<p>Not all the energy in cosmic rays is carried by mesons. We
also find showers of electrons. These are almost the same as
beta rays except that they have more energy and arrive frequently
in fairly sizeable numbers traveling along nearly
parallel tracks. Their effects, however, are the same as the
effects of the mesons.</p>
<p>We have been talking now about the interactions between
charged particles and the atomic electrons. No mention has
been made of interactions between the charged particles and
nuclei. Nuclear interactions do occur sometimes, but by and
large they have only a negligible influence in slowing down
the charged particle. They do affect, however, beta rays.</p>
<p>When a beta ray collides with a highly charged nucleus,
the beta particle is violently deflected. The violence of this
process is due to the heavy charge of the nucleus and the
small mass of the beta particle. In the sudden change of
velocity which occurs, part of the electric force field which
surrounds the electron breaks loose; the result is high-frequency
radiation called X-rays. The importance of such electromagnetic
radiation is that it can penetrate more deeply
into matter. In our bodies, for typical beta-ray energies, only
a small part of the beta-ray energy is converted into X-rays.
But in many radioactive processes gamma rays (which are
physically the same as X-rays) are produced quite abundantly.
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
These rays may carry as much or more energy than the beta
rays.</p>
<p>Unlike charged particles, which constantly interact as they
move through matter, gamma rays can go for long distances
without having a single encounter. The actual distance depends
on the energy of the gamma ray, the medium in which
it moves, and pure chance. On the average, a one-million-volt
gamma ray goes about six inches in water before anything
at all happens to it. A four-million-volt gamma ray
goes about a foot. In living matter the distances are approximately
the same. Thus gamma rays from an external source
can find their way deep inside the body.</p>
<p>Of course living matter is not injured by the mere presence
of a gamma ray. There is a small probability that the gamma
ray could go right through the body without a single encounter.
If so, there would be no biological effect. An effect
is produced only when the gamma ray interacts with the
matter. There are three most important ways in which such
an interaction may occur.</p>
<p>One way is simple <i>absorption</i> of the gamma ray by one of
the atomic electrons. The gamma ray disappears in this process,
and the electron acquires all of its energy. A tiny bit of
this energy is used for the electron to break its bond with the
atom. The remainder goes into kinetic motion of the electron.
The electron is now on the loose and can cause biological
damage by exciting and ionizing other atomic electrons.
In fact it is now the same thing which we used to call a beta
ray.</p>
<p>A second way in which the gamma ray may interact with
matter is by <i>scattering</i>. In this case the gamma ray does not
disappear but merely loses a part of its energy to the atomic
electron. Again the electron is free to cause biological damage,
while the gamma ray goes on to its next encounter.</p>
<p>The third way requires that the gamma ray be near a
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
nucleus and have an energy greater than a million electron-volts.
(Ordinary X-rays such as are used in medical practice
are not energetic enough for this process to occur.) Under
these conditions the gamma ray may disappear, with the
simultaneous appearance of an electron and a positron. This
is an example of the creation of matter out of pure energy.
In accordance with the formula E = mc&sup2;, a part of the
gamma-ray energy is consumed in producing particles with
definite masses. This amounts to about one million electron-volts.
The remainder of the gamma-ray energy goes into kinetic
motion of the two particles. Again biological damage
results from the subsequent ionization due to the charged
particles. After the positron has expended its kinetic energy
in the ionization process, it will join with an electron in a
disappearing act. The energy reappears in the form of two or
three gamma rays (each having less energy than the original
gamma ray).</p>
<p>In no case is the gamma ray directly responsible for any
biological damage. The damage is always made by electrons
(or positrons) to which the gamma ray has transferred some
or all of its energy. But this only makes gamma rays the more
dangerous. They can first penetrate to the sensitive tissues of
the body, and then cause ionization.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned that X-rays are the same as
gamma rays. The latter are produced by an excited nucleus,
the former in the collision of an electron (or a beta ray) with
a nucleus. The man-made X-rays are obtained by first accelerating
a stream of electrons and then letting them impinge on
a target containing highly charged nuclei.</p>
<p>The usefulness of X-rays is, of course, due to their power
of penetration; that is the same property which renders X-rays
dangerous. One can use X-rays to find out what happens
to be inside the human body. But this cannot be done without
producing some disruption and rearrangement in the
tissues which lie in the path of the X-rays. The damage is
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
of the same kind as that caused by radioactivity or cosmic
rays.</p>
<p>The effects of neutrons on matter are rather similar to the
effects of gamma rays. Like gamma rays, neutrons can travel
long distances in matter without interacting. On the average,
a million-volt neutron goes a few inches in water before having
a collision of any kind. Also like the gamma rays, the
neutrons are not themselves directly responsible for any biological
damage. Being neutral, they interact only with the
atomic nuclei to which they are strongly attracted. By far
the most important of these interactions is with the nuclei
of hydrogen. There are a great number of these in living tissue
in the form of protein and water molecules.</p>
<p>The collisions with hydrogen nuclei (i.e., protons) are important
because a large fraction of the neutron energy is
transferred in the process. This happens because the neutron
and the proton have very nearly the same weight. If the neutron
hits a heavy nucleus, it loses only a small fraction of its
energy in the impact.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> After colliding with hydrogen or a
heavier nucleus, the neutron continues on to other such collisions.
The nucleus, however, being charged and energetic,
now causes excitation and ionization of atomic electrons.
Thus, like gamma rays, energetic neutrons are exceedingly
dangerous, because they can first penetrate and then cause
ionization.</p>
<p>Neutrons are dangerous even when they are not energetic.
A nonenergetic neutron may react with nuclei of living matter
in a number of ways of which two are particularly probable.
Either the neutron may be captured by a proton to
form a deuteron, in which case the excess energy will be
emitted in the form of a two-million-volt gamma ray that
will cause further damage. Or the neutron may react with a
nucleus of nitrogen&sup1;&#8308; (abundantly present in living matter)
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
to produce a nucleus of carbon&sup1;&#8308; and an energetic proton.
Thus a nonenergetic neutron will have a biological effect
equivalent to an energetic gamma ray, or to an energetic
proton plus an energetic carbon&sup1;&#8308; ion.</p>
<p>In summary, all particles, charged or not, have a similar
action on matter. Directly or indirectly, they produce excited
atoms, molecules, and ion pairs. These processes always
occur in practically the same proportions, and therefore the
number of ion pairs formed can be used as a measure of the
radiation effects. The more ion pairs produced in living matter,
the greater the extent of biological damage. For this reason
it is customary to describe radiation effects in terms of
the number of ion pairs created per gram of living tissue in
various parts of the body. Since each ion pair corresponds to
an energy transfer of about 32 electron-volts, an alternative
description may be given in terms of the amount of energy
deposited. The unit in common usage for this purpose is the
<i>roentgen</i>, which means specifically an energy equivalent to
lifting the body (in which the radiation is deposited) by one
twenty-fifth of an inch. This is equivalent to about 60 million
million ion pairs in each ounce. It is less exact but more
significant to say that one roentgen deposits in a cell of our
body a few thousand ion pairs.</p>
<p>Of course the amount of ionization within individual cells
is not a quantity that is easily measured. What one usually
knows instead, is the roentgen dosage to a piece of tissue,
which consists of many cells. If the charged particles inducing
the ionization are electrons (as they are when the primary
radiation is a beta ray or a gamma ray), the ionization will
be distributed more or less uniformly among the cells in the
affected neighborhood. If the charged particle is heavy&mdash;a
proton or an alpha ray&mdash;the density of ionization which it
produces is much greater, so that some cells receive a good
many more ion pairs, while others nearby may receive none.
For this reason it is sometimes important to specify not just
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
how many roentgens the tissue has been exposed to, but also
which kind of radiation has been responsible.</p>
<p>In a later chapter we shall discuss the biological effects of
various amounts of radiation. We may mention here, however,
that 1000 roentgens of X-rays or gamma rays delivered
more or less uniformly over the whole body of a human being
in a time less than a few hours or so, will lead to almost certain
death. And it is a remarkable fact that nature has not
provided us with a warning. Radiation does not hurt. The
greater is the need that we understand this process which
affects our well-being but not our senses.</p>

<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />The Test</h2>
<p>Testing of atomic explosives is usually carried
out in beautiful surroundings. There is a good reason for
this: the radioactive fallout.</p>
<p>Because of the fallout, the test site must be isolated. The
presence of human population does not improve nature (with
exceptions which are quite rare and the more notable). Also,
to keep the site clean, tests must be carried out in the absence
of rain. Therefore, at the site one usually finds sunshine and
solitude.</p>
<p>For the participants the beauty of nature forms the back-drop
to preparations of experiments which are difficult and
exciting to everyone involved. At the end, the atomic explosion
is always dwarfed by its setting. But the work that
culminates in the detonation is rewarded by something quite
different from a flash and a bang.</p>
<p>The really important results of a test consist in marks on
photographic plates. Most of the apparatus that produced the
plates has been destroyed in the explosion. But enough is
saved so that one can conclude what has happened in the
short fractions of a second that pass between the pressing of
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
the button and the knowledge in the observer: this was it. In
those fractions of a second another stone was added to the
structure which we may call astrophysical engineering. What
happens and what is observed in nuclear explosions are
closely related to the behavior of matter in the interiors of
the stars.</p>
<p>The details of the nuclear explosion cannot be described
here for three reasons. First, the details are secret. Second,
the size of this book and the forbearance of the reader set
limitations. And third, we understand only a small part of
the process. Within these limitations, this is what happens:</p>
<p>The actual nuclear reaction takes only a fraction of a microsecond
(one microsecond = one millionth of a second).
All the energy of the bomb is released in this short period.
At the end of this period, the main body of the nuclear material
is moving apart at a rapid rate and by this motion
further nuclear reactions are stopped. In addition to the
more or less orderly outward motion, considerable portions
of the energy are found in the disorderly temperature motion,
which has stripped most of the electrons off the nuclei
and has transformed the atoms into a freely and chaotically
moving assembly of charged particles. By this time many of
the original nuclei have been transformed into nuclei of
radioactive species, partly by the fission process and partly by
the capture of neutrons in all sorts of atoms which had been
originally present in the bomb materials.</p>
<p>Still another portion of the energy is present as electromagnetic
radiation. This radiation closely resembles light except
that it is of shorter wave length and is therefore not actually
visible; but it can be absorbed and re-emitted by all sorts of
materials, and is in a violent exchange of energy with the
exploded bomb fragments.</p>
<p>All this perturbation spreads outward from the region
where the nuclear reaction has taken place into the surrounding
components of the bomb. During the outward spread,
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
more atoms and more space get engulfed. The agitation and
the radiation become somewhat less hot.</p>
<p>This hot region tends to be limited by a sharply defined
boundary which is called a shock front and which is moving
outward at a speed of several hundred miles per second. This
front finally reaches the limits of the more or less dense material
in which the whole bomb structure was originally encased.
It then breaks through into the surrounding air. The
air heats up in the immediate vicinity, and this is the beginning
of the fireball.</p>
<p>From this point on, the energy spreads due to the push of
the high-temperature air. A sharp shock front forms and
keeps moving outward at a speed greatly surpassing ordinary
sound speed. The radioactive material is contained within
this hot and expanding sphere.</p>
<p>As the fireball expands and the temperature falls, more and
more visible radiation is emitted. Actually, the surface is
growing less brilliant as the structure expands and cools, but
its greater size and the longer time that is available for the
emission of radiation overcome this disadvantage. Finally,
at a radius of perhaps a few hundred feet for a small bomb
and a mile for a big one, the fireball expansion halts. This
happens because the shock front is no longer strong enough to
make the air luminous. The luminosity not only stops advancing
but is actually partly dimmed by absorbing substances
formed by the badly mistreated air molecules.</p>
<p>The time which has elapsed to reach this stage of the explosion
depends on the bomb energy. If two explosions are
compared, and the bigger one has a thousand times the explosive
power of the smaller one, then the time needed to
reach the extreme expansion of the fireball will be approximately
ten times greater for the more violent event. In any
case, a reasonably close observer has to use strongly absorbing
glasses during this time if he is not to be blinded. For small
bombs, the expansion of the fireball is too short to register.
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
For the really big ones, you can see the expansion developing
and you wonder when it will stop. To the unprotected eye
the small bombs are almost as dangerous as the big ones,
because there is not enough time to blink.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the shock wave, now separated from the
fireball, travels through the air and carries with it a considerable
fraction of the original explosive power. An important
part of the damage which a bomb can cause is due to this invisible
pressure wave which spreads with a speed close to that
of sound, over a distance of miles, before it settles down into
harmless rumbling.</p>
<p>The rest of the energy is still sitting in the fireball near
the point where the explosion occurred and the hot air now
commences to ascend, breaking up into a turbulent mushroom
as it goes. The hot interior portions get occasionally
exposed and the object gives the appearance of an enormous
flaming mass, at least when seen in a motion picture which
slows down the action and reduces the size. The radiant
tongues are too big and too fast for any ordinary flames.</p>
<p>During this stage the display gradually pales sufficiently so
that it can be viewed with the naked eye. The originally hot
masses have now emitted enough energy in the form of light
and mixed with a sufficiently great mass of cool air that they
no longer glow violently. This mass of central and rising gas
contains practically all the radioactivity, not only that originally
formed in the explosion but also some produced by
neutrons which leaked out of the bomb and got captured by
a variety of nuclei in the air, water, or ground within the
neighborhood.</p>
<p>And now the aftermath of the explosion is turning into a
display growing rapidly and yet in a measured manner so
that not only the eye of the observer but his mind and his
feelings can follow the events. The mushroom which has been
formed by the first updraft develops into a column with
more and more agitated boiling masses added on the top and
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
with slanting skirts of a snowy appearance descending toward
the sides. What is this white mass that looks just like a cloud
of peculiar shape and that has grown up to the high heavens
(or as the meteorologists call it: the stratosphere) in a few
minutes before our eyes?</p>
<p>It is actually a cloud: a collection of droplets of water too
small to turn into rain but big enough to reflect the white
light of the sun. And it is formed in a similar way to the
cumulus clouds of a thunderstorm. Indeed it is a beautiful
example of a many-storied castle of cumulus upon cumulus.
But strangely enough what makes this cloud is not the heat
of the bomb. It is the cooling of the air masses that have been
sucked in as the remnants of the fireball rush upward like
a giant balloon. Under this balloon air is drawn upward. As
this air rises, it cools and water vapor contained in it condenses
into droplets: precisely the same mechanism which
gives rise to thunderheads on a hot summer day.</p>
<p>The white skirts (which are not always present) do not
consist of any material that is falling out of the cloud. On the
contrary, a moist layer of air is sucked up into the cloud from
the side and the droplets which form in this layer give rise to
a cloud-sheet with the appearance of a skirt.</p>
<p>In big bombs near the top a particularly smooth and white
cap is seen. This is again condensation, not into droplets but
into fine crystals of ice. In some explosions more than one of
these caps are present.</p>
<p>Finally the cloud has gained its full height. Depending on
the size of the bomb it may have grown to 20,000 feet, to
100,000 feet or more. Then the wind blowing at various levels
in various directions tears the structure apart sweeping some
of it to the east, some to the west. The radioactive debris in
the cloud has started on its travel.</p>
<p>What this radioactivity will do, how it can affect living
beings, how dangerous it actually is, we shall discuss in succeeding
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
chapters. But one thing is clear and remains present
in the minds of all participants in an atomic test: The danger
of the test is nothing compared to the catastrophe that
may occur if great numbers of these weapons should be used
in an unrestricted nuclear war.</p>
<p>It has been frequently asserted that our present atomic
explosives can wipe out the cities and industries of the greatest
countries. Why continue with further development and
testing?</p>
<p>The answer is simple: The main purpose of a war is not to
destroy the enemy&rsquo;s civilian centers but rather to defeat his
armed forces, and for this purpose we need flexible refined
weapons of all kinds and sizes. We also need weapons with
which to defend our own cities. We need weapons with
which to defend our allies and in particular we need weapons
which will do their job against an aggressor and will do the
least possible damage to the innocent bystander.</p>
<p>In this last respect, in particular, notable progress has been
made. We are developing clean weapons which are effective
by their blast and their heat, but which produce little radioactivity.
Of course, blast and heat will do damage only near
the point of detonation. Radioactivity may be carried by the
winds and escape the control of man to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>It is clear that war is and always has been terrible. We refuse
to believe that wars will always be with us but we cannot
disregard the danger of war as long as the world is half free
and half slave.</p>
<p>An atomic war, limited or even unlimited, need not be
connected with more suffering than past wars. However, such
a war would probably be more violent and it would be
shorter.</p>
<p>The story is told that a war which turned out to be perhaps
the most dreadful in the history of mankind was started with
this message: &ldquo;Thou hast chosen war. That will happen
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
which will happen and what is to be we know not. God alone
knows.&rdquo; Perhaps the only possible path for a free people is
to be well prepared for war but never to choose war as long
as the choice is free. But what will happen God alone knows.</p>

<br />The Radioactive Cloud</h2>
<p>In February 1954 preparations were made on
Bikini Atoll for the explosion of a hydrogen bomb. March 1
was the &ldquo;ready&rdquo; date. It did not seem probable that the shot
would actually be fired on that date because the shot could
be fired only under quite favorable wind conditions. Large
amounts of radioactivity, especially fission products, were
expected from the explosion. The shot could be fired only if
no inhabited places lay in the downwind direction.</p>
<p>Bikini is an oval-shaped coral reef, an atoll. It is one of
several such atolls belonging to the group called the Marshall
Islands. If you look at the map, you will see that west of
Bikini at a distance of 200 miles lies Eniwetok, on which our
people were making preparations for further tests.</p>
<p>To the east of Bikini, a hundred miles or so, is Rongelap
Atoll. At that time 64 people were living there. They lived
primitively in palm houses on the southern part of the atoll.
The northern part was uninhabited.</p>
<p>On nearby Ailinginae Atoll 18 of the Marshallese islanders
were on a fishing expedition, while farther to the east on
Rongerik 28 American servicemen were stationed. The servicemen
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
lived and worked in aluminum huts. Their main job
was to collect weather data.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="414" />
<p class="pcap">Map of the Marshall Islands</p>
</div>
<p>Much farther to the east, 300 miles from Bikini, is Utirik.
One hundred and fifty-seven Marshallese people lived on
this atoll.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of March 1, a Japanese fishing boat
lay somewhere to the north of Rongelap. Her name was
Fukuryu Maru, which means in English the Fortunate
Dragon. There were 23 men on board. Actually she was in a
patrolled zone but had not been sighted by the patrol aircraft.</p>
<p>Operations for the test were being directed from ships of
Joint Task Force 7. For several days prior to the morning of
March 1, the weathermen had been mapping the winds. A
wind to the west would be bad for Eniwetok. A wind to the
east might hurt Rongelap and Rongerik. A wind to the south
could affect Kwajalein. The ideal direction would have been
due north, but this probably would not happen for months.
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
On &ldquo;shot&rdquo; morning the wind was blowing to the northeast.
The meteorologists gave their &ldquo;O.K.&rdquo; It was at dawn, the
first of March, 1954.</p>
<p>The firing crew of nine people led by a man of considerable
experience, Jack Clark, were responsible for the final arrangements.
They were in a blockhouse on the south side of
the atoll 20 miles from the bomb. Others, more than 1000
people, watched from shipboard under the direction of Al
Graves, who was responsible for the technical phases of the
operation. The ships lay south and a little east of Bikini.</p>
<p>The firing mechanism was set into operation in the blockhouse.
One after another signals indicated that the various
experiments and observations were set to work. Finally a red
light went off and a green light appeared on the panel. This
meant that the bomb had been detonated.</p>
<p>The men on shipboard watched the enormous fireball
through darkened glasses. The firing crew, sealed off in the
blockhouse, saw nothing. A couple of long seconds and
Graves&rsquo; voice announced over their radio: &ldquo;It was a good
shot.&rdquo; A quick estimate indicated 15 megatons.</p>
<p>Some more slow seconds and the expected ground shock
arrived. It was like a big earthquake. A bad moment passed.
The blockhouse rocked but held.</p>
<p>Another minute or so and the air shock passed over. One
could hear the hinges groan&mdash;but this was no longer frightening.</p>
<p>Would the water wave pour over the blockhouse? Everything
was watertight. After fifteen minutes a porthole was
opened&mdash;no water came in. The men in the blockhouse
emerged to look at the drifting atomic cloud.</p>
<p>While they watched, Jack Clark&rsquo;s radiation instrument began
to show a reading. The firing crew was called back into
the blockhouse. There, in the lowest corner shielded by a
considerable amount of sand, they were safe. Outside, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
evaporated and condensing coral came down in pellets carrying
more and more radioactivity.</p>
<p>In the meantime there was fallout on the ships too. The
wind had definitely veered after shot time. Quickly the activity
was washed down. No one got a dangerous exposure.
But it was wiser to sail away. A message was sent to the blockhouse:
&ldquo;We will come back for you in the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a little more than an hour the activity around the
blockhouse started slowly to decrease. The firing crew waited
patiently inside without communication, without light for
the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Finally the ships came back. At sundown a helicopter went
out to the island using the last of daylight and allowing as
much time as possible for the activity to decay. Clark and
his friends rushed out of the blockhouse wrapped in sheets
to stop the beta rays and keep off the radioactive dust. They
moved as fast as possible to avoid unnecessary exposure.</p>
<p>It was a hard experience but they got no more than two
roentgens&mdash;no more reason to worry than if they had had a
medical X-ray. Toward the east, however, some people were
in real trouble.</p>
<p>Six or seven hours after the shot the American servicemen
on Rongerik noticed a mistlike fallout of highly radioactive
dust. The wind had veered enough to carry the atomic cloud
over the occupied islands of Ailinginae, Rongelap, and Rongerik.
In the anxious hours which followed no one could say
how much damage had been done.</p>
<p>The Americans on Rongerik had had some education in
the dangers of radioactivity. They washed themselves, put on
extra clothes, and remained inside of the aluminum huts as
much as possible. These actions helped to protect them
against beta ray burns on the skin. The Marshallese on
Rongelap and Ailinginae knew nothing of the danger and
took no precautions. Many of them suffered quite severe skin
burns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>All of the exposed persons were evacuated to Kwajalein as
soon as the Task Force facilities would permit. But it was
not until a week or so after the explosion that arrangements
could be made for men with radiation measuring instruments
to tour the atolls and determine what the levels of exposure
had been.</p>
<p>On the southern tip of Rongerik they measured the activity
and calculated that the American servicemen had received
approximately 78 roentgens. This was good news because a
dosage of 50 to 100 roentgens is not lethal and only in rare
cases leads to any sickness. In any event full recovery could
be expected within a few days.</p>
<p>As they prowled around Rongerik atoll, the measuring
crew found places where the radiation levels had been much
higher. At the northern end a person would have received
more than 200 roentgens.</p>
<p>On Ailinginae the measured values were comparable to
those on Rongerik. The estimated dosage to the Ailinginae
people was 69 roentgens.</p>
<p>On Rongelap the situation was much worse. Measurements
in the southern part of the atoll showed that the Rongelap
people had gotten a dose of about 175 roentgens. Such a dose
would not be fatal, but at least some of the people would
probably be sick.</p>
<p>The crew then went on to explore the rest of the atoll. As
they moved north, the dose levels rose higher and higher. In
the middle of the atoll, only ten or fifteen miles from the inhabited
part, a person would have received 400 roentgens of
radiation. At this level he would have a fifty-fifty chance of
surviving.</p>
<p>On the northern tip of the atoll, about thirty miles away,
the dose would have been over a thousand roentgens. Such a
dose means certain death in less than a month.</p>

<p>On Kwajalein the Marshallese were cared for and underwent
medical observation. As soon as possible their skin and
hair were scrubbed with soap and water. The coconut oil in
their hair made decontamination difficult.</p>
<p>During all this time the presence of the Japanese fishing
boat in the area was not even suspected. Not until two
weeks after the explosion, when the little boat returned to
Yaizu harbor, did the world find out. By this time the 23
fishermen were pretty sick. We do not know precisely what
dose the fishermen received, but the best guess is about 200
roentgens. Unhappily, one of the fishermen died, presumably
from complications associated with the exposure to radiation.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a>
The other 22, however, are in good health and back at work.</p>
<p>Our medical information on the Marshallese islanders is
complete. After staying three months on Kwajalein they were
removed to Majuro atoll, where homes were built for them
and where they have been cared for and under continuous
surveillance since the incident. Frequent and thorough medical
examinations have been conducted, handicapped somewhat
by the problem of communicating through an interpreter.</p>
<p>In the first twenty-four hours some of the victims complained
of nausea, fever, and stomach-ache. But these symptoms
abated promptly in every case without treatment. There
was also some complaint of skin itching and a burning sensation,
but these symptoms also lasted only a couple of days.
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
Then followed a week or so of comfort and no complaint.
After that skin lesions and loss of hair began to occur.</p>
<p>Fifty to eighty per cent of the beta rays during the exposure
period had an average energy of 0.3 million electron-volts.
Much of this energy was stopped in the outer layer of skin,
which is two thousandths of an inch thick. The remainder of
the beta rays had an average energy of 0.6 million electron-volts;
these beta rays could easily penetrate into the deeper
layer of live skin. The most important fact, however, was that
clothing of any kind, even a thin cotton fabric, provided protection
against all the beta rays. Lesions developed only on the
exposed parts of the body and in a few other places such as
the armpits and the creases of the neck where material tends
to accumulate. Bare feet were especially bad. During the
acute period some of the people walked on their heels.</p>
<p>At the end of six months lost hair had grown out again unaltered
in texture and color, and the skin lesions had healed.
Everyone appeared healthy and normal with no apparent
after effects.</p>
<p>There had been four pregnancies amongst Rongelap
women at the time of the exposure. One baby was born dead,
but the other three were quite normal. There was no evidence
that the stillbirth had been due to radiation effects. In
fact the percentage of stillbirths amongst the Rongelapese is
normally high. Statistically, one in four is not an unusual
ratio.</p>
<p>Today, more than three years since the accident, all of the
Marshallese and American victims seem to be fully recovered.
No malignancies or leukemias have shown up, but these long-term
effects are still being carefully watched for by an AEC
medical group.</p>
<p>All in all some serious but limited harm has been done. It
was a close shave. To see how close, one only needs to glance
at the map below, which shows the roentgen dosage for 48
hours of exposure. At the southern tip of Rongelap, where
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
the inhabitants lived, the dosage was 175 roentgens. But at
the northern tip, less than thirty miles away, the dosage was
more than a thousand roentgens. If the wind had veered just
a little bit farther to the south, probably all of the people on
Ailinginae, Rongelap, and Rongerik would have been killed.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="306" />
<p class="pcap">Dosage in First 48 Hours After Fallout Began</p>
</div>
<p>This shot proved what had been argued for many years:
that radioactivity is not just an incidental part of an atomic
explosion. The people on Rongelap were far outside the area
of danger from blast and thermal effects. But they received a
sizeable dose of radiation. In fact, a person could have stood
unprotected at a distance of thirty miles from the explosion
and been perfectly safe from the blast and thermal radiation.
But at that same distance in a downwind direction he would
have accumulated a lethal dose of radiation within a matter
of minutes after the fallout began.</p>
<p>Because of the radioactive fallout, the test sites must be
located in remote parts of the world. It would be desirable if
sites could be found which are so remote from populous areas
that the tests could be conducted without regard to the direction
of the winds. Unfortunately the bombs are too big and
the planet is too small.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>As a result the winds must be watched before every test;
and the tests must be delayed until the winds are favorable.
What happened to the Marshallese was an accident which
might have been avoided if the winds had been blowing more
directly toward the north at shot time. Since this accident the
wind requirements for the tests have become far more
stringent, our knowledge of the danger has increased, and
the rules of safety have in all respects improved. Many large
yield weapons have been tested since March 1, 1954, but no
other accidents have occurred. We can be confident that accidents
of this kind are now very improbable.</p>
<p>At the U. S. test site in Nevada there has been no instance
of a major fallout on a populated area. Probably the most
worrisome situation which has occurred there was in the
spring of 1953 during the Upshot-Knothole test series. After
the ninth shot of the series the cloud drifted eastward over
St. George, Utah, a town of about 5000 people. Some fallout
occurred shortly before nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
About nine-thirty AEC officials issued a warning advising the
residents to stay indoors. By noon the warning was withdrawn
and people were allowed to continue with their normal
affairs. The incident left everyone a little bit scared, but no
one had received a radiation dose greater than two or three
roentgens.</p>
<p>We have been talking about the local fallout which occurs
within a few hundred miles of the test site. Not all the radioactivity
which is made in the explosion goes into this fallout.
Some of it travels for really long distances, not hundreds but
actually thousands of miles from ground zero. This part of
the radioactivity is disseminated world-wide and completely
escapes the control of man. To be sure, by the time this radioactivity
is distributed over a large fraction of the earth&rsquo;s surface,
the dosage levels of radiation are very tiny, less than a
ten thousandth of a roentgen for a megaton explosion. There
is no danger whatever that a person would die or even become
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
mildly sick from this amount of radiation. There is,
however, the possibility of long-range effects such as bone
cancer, leukemia, and genetic mutation.</p>
<p>The world-wide danger is, of course, primarily due to the
big bombs. The little ones, such as are tested in Nevada, release
about ten kilotons (TNT equivalent) of fission energy.
Some of the big ones in the Pacific release a few megatons of
fission energy. Since the amount of radioactivity is proportional
to the fission energy released, one big bomb is equivalent
to several hundred or possibly a thousand little ones. Altogether
in Nevada, to date, there have been only sixty or seventy
shots. It may be desirable to minimize the world-wide
fallout from the big shots in the Pacific. But for the little
shots in Nevada, it is probably more important to minimize
the local fallout. How much radioactivity goes into the local
fallout, how much into the world-wide, and how these relative
amounts can be controlled, are the main topics for the
remainder of this chapter.</p>
<p>Not all the radioactivity which is made in the explosion
contributes to the fallout, either local or world-wide. Some of
the radioactive fission fragments (gamma emitters) have such
short half-lives<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> that they actually disintegrate before the
bomb has disassembled. A great many others disintegrate in
the first few minutes while the atomic cloud is rising. The
energetic beta and gamma rays released in these early, rapid
disintegrations are stopped in short distances and merely add
to the havoc at the scene of the explosion.</p>

Cutaway section of a nuclear reactor. The heart of the reactor
is a small region at the center where the fission energy
is generated. Most of the weight and volume are needed for
cooling apparatus and shielding material to keep in nuclear
radiation.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>For the radioactivity to affect areas at a large distance from
the point of the explosion, considerable time must elapse
while the atomic cloud rises and drifts in the horizontal
winds. During this time more disintegrations occur, due
mainly to the short-lived nuclei. The rate at which they occur
keeps diminishing as the short-lived nuclei disappear.
Roughly speaking, the rate diminishes simply in proportion
to the time. More precisely, the rate drops somewhat faster,
decreasing by a factor of ten when the time increases by a
factor of seven. A minute after the explosion the activity is
less than one per cent of what it is at a second. After an hour
it is less than one per cent of its value at a minute. This law
for the decrease in activity of fission products is, of course,
quite different from the simple law of radioactive decay. The
latter law applies to a single radioactive species. The fission
products consist at any instant of many different radioactive
species. Each one obeys the simple law of radioactive decay,
but the totality follows a different law.</p>
<p>It should be kept in mind that the product nucleus of a
radioactive disintegration may itself be radioactive with a
different half-life. For example, there is strontium&#8313;&#8304;. Only a
small amount of this isotope is made directly in the fission
process. The fission process yields large quantities of krypton&#8313;&#8304;,
which decays with a half-life of one-half minute into
rubidium&#8313;&#8304;. The latter has a half-life of three minutes and
decays into strontium&#8313;&#8304;. This is how practically all of the
strontium&#8313;&#8304; is made in the explosion. Thus both the intensity
and the nature of the radioactivity keep changing with time.</p>
<p>These facts are important because they determine the magnitude
and the character of the danger when the radioactivity
finally falls out of the cloud and is deposited on the surface
of the earth. Those radioactive particles which disintegrate
while still in the cloud need not worry us since this radiation
can have no effect on living organisms that may be underneath.
Provided that the cloud is more than a few hundred
feet above the ground, the beta and gamma rays released in
these disintegrations merely dissipate their energy in ionizing
the air.</p>
<p>The time which the radioactive debris spends in the cloud
depends most critically on one factor: the proximity of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
explosion to the ground surface. The nature of the surface,
whether it is soil or water, also plays a role. If the explosion
has taken place right on the ground, on a soil surface, a lot of
big, heavy dirt particles become incorporated into the fireball
and begin to fall under the action of gravity even before
the cloud stops rising. This fallout continues for a period of
several hours to perhaps a half day. At the same time some of
the radioactive fission products which have adhered to these
dirt particles also fall out. This is the origin of the so-called
close-in or local fallout, which extends for a distance downwind
of the explosion of a few miles to a few hundred miles,
according to the energy of the bomb and the strength of the
winds. Approximately eighty per cent or so of all the fission
products are accounted for by this close-in fallout in the case
of a surface explosion. The shot on March 1, 1954 was of this
variety.</p>
<p>There are several possibilities for influencing the amount
of close-in fallout. One is to explode the bomb over deep
water. In this case the close-in fallout amounts to between
thirty and fifty per cent. This is because many of the water
drops to which radioactive particles have adhered evaporate
before they hit the ground. Over shallow water, however, if
the fireball actually touches the bottom, the close-in fallout
resembles the case of a land explosion and is again about
eighty per cent or so. The close-in fallout for underground or
underwater explosions will be even higher than for the surface
explosions. In fact a really deep underground or underwater
explosion would be completely contained and no activity
would be spread around.</p>
<p>Another possibility for reducing the close-in fallout is to
detonate the bomb on a tower so tall that the fireball cannot
touch the surface. In this case the amount of close-in fallout
is reduced from eighty per cent to approximately five per
cent. Of course, it is not feasible to build towers for really big
bombs whose fireballs may be a mile or so in diameter. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
this case the bomb might be dropped from an airplane to produce
the same effect. The Hiroshima explosion was an example
of an air burst of a small bomb. The close-in fallout in
that case was very small. Such radiation sickness as occurred
there was due to the direct gamma rays and neutrons released
in the explosion itself.</p>
<p>In the case of a near-surface explosion, where the fireball
almost touches the ground, the close-in fallout is also only
about five per cent. This is a somewhat surprising fact since
in this case photographs show large quantities of surface material
being sucked up into the cloud, just as they are in a
true surface explosion.</p>
<p>This material certainly consists of large, heavy dirt particles
which subsequently fall out of the cloud. Yet most of
them somehow fail to come in contact with the radioactive
fission products.</p>
<p>This peculiar phenomenon can be understood by looking
at the details of how the fireball rises. At first the central part
of the fireball is much hotter than the outer part and thus
rises more rapidly. As it rises, however, it cools and falls back
around the outer part, creating in this way a doughnut-shaped
structure. The whole process is analogous to the formation
of an ordinary smoke ring. In most of the photographs
one sees, the doughnut is obscured by the cloud of water that
forms, but sometimes when the weather is particularly dry,
it becomes perfectly visible. During the rather orderly circulation
of air through the hole, the bomb debris and the dirt
that has been sucked up remain separated. (See <a href="#fig7">pictures 1-4</a>.)</p>
<p>The close-in fallout accounts for only a portion of the
radioactivity, ranging from less than a per cent for a high
altitude shot to almost complete deposition for some ground
shots. For the world-wide fallout we are interested in what
happens to the remainder. This depends on how the atomic
cloud is carried by the upper winds for long distances. In this
connection it is important to distinguish between a big bomb
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
and a little bomb. It is also important to distinguish between
the lower and higher portions of the atmosphere called, respectively,
the troposphere and the stratosphere.</p>
<p>The atmosphere is heated by the sun in an indirect way.
The sun&rsquo;s rays pass through air without warming it. They
heat up instead the bottom of the atmosphere, that is, the
solid ground. The atmosphere is heated in the same manner
in which a boiling pot is heated on the kitchen range. The
heat is delivered from below and is carried in rising currents
to the top.</p>
<p>Only in the case of the atmosphere there is no sharp upper
limit. The currents rise to an altitude of thirty to fifty thousand
feet, then turn and descend. This boiling part of the
atmosphere is called the troposphere or region of heat. Above
it there is less vertical motion. The upper region is called the
stratosphere or stratified region.</p>
<p>For a little bomb the atomic cloud stops rising before it
reaches the stratosphere. For a big bomb, above about a
megaton of energy (a million tons of TNT equivalent), the
cloud pokes right into the stratosphere and keeps going to a
height of a hundred thousand feet or so.</p>
<p>The most important fact about the stratosphere is this: It
has very little weather. Most of the weather phenomena such
as clouds, rain, snow, fog, mist, etc., are confined to the lower
portion of the atmosphere, the troposphere. The stratosphere,
however, contains practically no water.</p>
<p>Now suppose a little bomb whose cloud will remain in the
troposphere has been exploded at one of the United States
test sites. The Nevada test site is at a latitude of 37&deg;N and the
Pacific test site at 12&deg;N. In these middle latitudes, in the
troposphere, the winds blow mainly from west to east with an
average speed of approximately 20 miles an hour. There will
be a slight southerly or northerly motion on top of this. But
by and large the radioactive cloud will stay in a pretty narrow
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
band around the latitude at which the explosion took
place.</p>
<p>After the first few hours, when the close-in fallout has
dwindled, the radioactive particles remaining in the cloud
are too light and too fine to fall any more under the action of
gravity. At this point the weather becomes important. Rain,
fog, or mist captures the radioactive particles, and returns
them to the ground in the rainfall. This results in the so-called
tropospheric fallout.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> The average time for this fallout
to occur is approximately two weeks to a month. During
this time, while staying more or less in the latitude of the explosion,
the radioactive particles may actually have encircled
the earth.</p>
<p>The clouds of the big bombs rise high into the stratosphere.
The winds in the stratosphere do not blow so predominantly
in a latitudinal direction. What is more important, they stay
in the stratosphere for years, in which time the radioactivity
is distributed to all areas of the globe. The fallout from the
big bombs is thus really world-wide.</p>
<p>The tropospheric fallout takes about a month. The stratospheric
fallout takes 5 to 10 years. The reason for this difference
is the weather, or rather the lack of it. In the stratosphere
there is no rain or fog to catch the radioactive particles
and hence no effective mechanism for producing the fallout.
In fact, since the radioactive particles are too fine to fall by
gravity, they must simply wait until some turbulent motions
impel them downward back into the troposphere. This process
requires a long time.</p>
<p>That rainfall is the most important mechanism for producing
the world-wide fallout has been shown by examining the
fallout in certain dry regions of southern California and
South America. In every case the fallout was found to be considerably
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
sub-normal. In one place in Chile, where there is
never any rain, the fallout was found to be only one per cent
of what might be expected on the basis of the average fallout
at the same latitude.</p>
<p>In regions having at least a few inches of rain per year, the
fallout tends to be proportional to the rainfall on the average.
However, the proportionality to rainfall depends on the nature
of the weather so that, say, twenty inches of rain in one
part of the world may not give as much fallout as the same
amount of rain in other weather zones. We are rapidly learning
about this.</p>
<p>Having said what the age is of the various kinds of fallout,
we are in a position to say which radioactive species are still
present when the radioactivity is deposited on the ground.
The close-in fallout, being only a few hours old, still includes
many short-lived isotopes, which disintegrate before there is a
possibility of ingestion or inhalation into the body. Consequently
the danger from the close-in fallout results from external
exposure, mainly to gamma radiation on the whole
body, and to a lesser extent to energetic beta rays on the skin.
Clothes and ordinary housing provide relatively little shielding
against gamma rays. Special protective shelters are
needed. During a war if the enemy were to bomb our cities
with super-megaton weapons surface-burst, the close-in fallout
would be a far greater agent of destruction against an unsheltered
populace than either blast or thermal radiation.</p>
<p>In the stratospheric world-wide fallout, however, all of
the short-lived radioactivity has disappeared, since a period
of many years has elapsed since the explosion. After a year or
so the only gamma emitter which is left in appreciable quantity
is cesium&sup1;&sup3;&#8311;, with a half-life of 30 years. Its gamma ray,
however, is not very penetrating. In spite of this fact cesium&sup1;&sup3;&#8311;
is considered to be the second most important hazard for the
long term fallout. The first is strontium&#8313;&#8304;, which is a beta
emitter with a half-life of 28 years. This is long enough so
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
that most of these nuclei will still be present even after spending
a long time in the stratosphere. Since strontium is chemically
similar to calcium, it contaminates our foodstuffs and is
easily incorporated into our bodies. Once inside it stays for
long periods of time, deposited in our bones. We shall see in
a later chapter how serious this danger may be.</p>
<p>The tropospheric fallout, and to a lesser extent, the stratospheric,
includes some other radioactive species besides
cesium&sup1;&sup3;&#8311; and strontium&#8313;&#8304;, and we shall discuss these in the
next chapter. But by and large they are of little consequence
(with the possible exception of iodine&sup1;&sup3;&sup1;) either because they
are not easily absorbed in the body or else because their radiation
is not very energetic. The world-wide hazard is thus
narrowed down to just two isotopes, an internal beta emitter
and a weak gamma emitter.</p>

<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />From the Soil to Man</h2>
<p>There is a bewildering variety of radioactive
products deposited in the fallout. Given certain conditions all
of them could be dangerous to man. Actually, very few are.</p>
<p>An example of a radioactive isotope which is produced in
large quantity by the fission process and about which there
is some reason to worry, but actually is not dangerous to man,
is iodine&sup1;&sup3;&sup1;. This isotope in the fallout is not dangerous because
it has a rather short half-life: eight days.</p>
<p>During the first weeks after a nuclear explosion some
radioactive iodine may fall out of the cloud and contaminate
grazing land. A cow eats hundreds of pounds of grass in a
few days time. Now iodine is found in the cow&rsquo;s body or in
the body of any mammal mainly in one spot. This is the
thyroid gland located in man near the Adam&rsquo;s apple. The
thyroid gland is important because it secretes a chemical
which regulates many of the body functions. In man, these
include how we burn up our food and in what mood we are.
About twenty per cent of all the iodine which is taken up,
whether radioactive or natural, is concentrated in this one
rather small gland. Such a concentration is precisely the kind
of danger for which we must watch.</p>
<p>Shortly after nuclear tests, cows that graze on range land
have been found with abnormally large amounts of radioactive
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
iodine, although not so large as to be harmful. In human
beings, however, the measured levels of radioactive iodine
are less than a hundredth of what they are in the cows
because by the time this radioactive isotope has reached man,
it has mostly decayed into a stable, harmless variety of xenon
gas.</p>
<p>There are many potentially dangerous isotopes in the radioactive
debris of a nuclear explosion. But most of them decay
too soon to affect man.</p>
<p>Isotopes which live an extremely long time compared to
the human life-span are also not dangerous to man. A radioactive
particle in the body is not harmful unless it disintegrates
and releases its energy while the individual is still alive.</p>
<p>Two examples of long-lived radioactive isotopes, which are
used as fuel in the bombs and which may be left over from
the explosion in large quantities, are: uranium&sup2;&sup3;&#8309; and plutonium&sup2;&sup3;&#8313;.
Uranium&sup2;&sup3;&#8309; has a half-life of 710 million years,
which is much too long to be dangerous. Plutonium has a
half-life of 24,000 years and is somewhat more dangerous.
The danger from plutonium arises because it emits an energetic
alpha ray.</p>
<p>The danger from radioactivity depends on the kind of particle
emitted&mdash;alpha, beta, or gamma rays&mdash;and whether these
rays attack the body from the inside or the outside. From the
outside the gamma rays are the most dangerous and the alpha
rays the least dangerous. From the inside the order is just
reversed.</p>
<p>To cause damage from the outside the radiation must be
very penetrating. Gamma rays can go through the whole
body. Beta rays are stopped in the skin tissue. Alpha rays cannot
even penetrate the outer layer of non-living, protective
skin.</p>
<p>On the inside, however, in the sensitive organs, the short
range of the alpha rays makes them exceedingly dangerous.
Their energy is concentrated in a small amount of tissue to
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
which damage is severe. The beta rays cause a slightly less
concentrated damage, and the gamma rays the least concentrated
of all.</p>
<p>Radioactivity may enter the body as contamination in the
food we eat or in the air we breathe. To be dangerous, however,
it must remain in the body, either in the intestines or
the lungs or in other vital organs, long enough for disintegrations
to occur, which will ionize and injure the living cells.</p>
<p>Fortunately, plutonium in our food is easily excreted from
the body. Only a few thousandths of a per cent of what is
eaten, is actually absorbed. If inhaled, large particles are
stopped in the nasal passages. Small particles get into the
lungs but are quickly exhaled. Only intermediate sized particles
are absorbed. However, the plutonium which is absorbed
generally gets laid down in the bones, where it stays
for a long period of time. Altogether, plutonium in the small
amounts we usually deal with is not one of the greater dangers
to human beings. Perhaps its most disagreeable property is
that, being an alpha emitter, it is not very easy to detect.
Since alpha particles do not penetrate through the surface of
most radiation meters, special instruments are needed to find
them.</p>
<p>Two fission products which are readily absorbed upon ingestion
are: strontium&#8313;&#8304; (Sr&#8313;&#8304;) and cesium&sup1;&sup3;&#8311; (Cs&sup1;&sup3;&#8311;). Depending
somewhat on their chemical form, approximately thirty-five
per cent of the Sr&#8313;&#8304; is absorbed, and all of the Cs&sup1;&sup3;&#8311; is
absorbed. Both of these isotopes are plentifully made in the
fission process. Moreover they have very &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; half-lives&mdash;about
30 years&mdash;which is long enough so that decay
is negligible between the explosion and contact with man,
but short enough so that decay is probable after contact.</p>
<p>From such arguments as these one concludes that Sr&#8313;&#8304; and
Cs&sup1;&sup3;&#8311; are the most important isotopes for the internal hazard
from the world-wide fallout. One can be reasonably sure that
there are no others of importance, because careful and extensive
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
research has not found significant amounts of any in our
bodies. We need not fear that one has been overlooked, because
the beta activity of the fission products is always easy to
detect.</p>
<p>The two main questions which we have to answer are these:
In what precise way will the dangerous elements Sr&#8313;&#8304; and
Cs&sup1;&sup3;&#8311; be distributed in the body? And after they are distributed,
what kind of damage will they produce?</p>
<p>We know too little about the chemistry of the living body
to obtain a complete answer to the second question. Hence it
has to be admitted that the actual danger cannot be stated in
a precise way.</p>
<p>Fortunately, enough is known from direct experience to
obtain a good value for the greatest damage that might be
produced. In the present chapter we shall describe what is
known about the uptake of the dangerous elements into the
body. In following chapters we shall turn to the question
of the biological consequences.</p>
<p>We may begin by comparing the danger from Cs&sup1;&sup3;&#8311; with
that from Sr&#8313;&#8304;. Both of these isotopes are made in the fission
process in about equal numbers. (Roughly 2 or 2&frac12; per
cent of all the fission products are Sr&#8313;&#8304;, and 3 per cent Cs&sup1;&sup3;&#8311;.)
They have approximately the same radioactive half-lives. But
they differ in an important respect: The Cs&sup1;&sup3;&#8311; is deposited
more or less uniformly throughout the body; the Sr&#8313;&#8304; is concentrated
in the bones.</p>
<p>Cs&sup1;&sup3;&#8311; emits a large part of its radioactive energy in the form
of a gamma ray, which causes ionization uniformly in the
body. Sr&#8313;&#8304;, on the other hand, emits all of its energy in the
form of two beta rays, which have ranges of only a small fraction
of an inch in the bone. Thus in the one case the radioactive
disintegration energy is distributed in the whole body;
in the other, the energy is deposited in the bones only.</p>
<p>Since the bones comprise about ten per cent of the total
body weight, they are subjected to ten times the radiation
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
dosage. The bones are quite sensitive to radiation, and an
overdosage can cause bone cancer and interfere with the production
of blood cells that goes on in the marrow. Thus we
are led to the conclusion that Sr&#8313;&#8304; is a far greater potential
hazard than Cs&sup1;&sup3;&#8311;. A further point, which leads to the same
conclusion, is that Cs&sup1;&sup3;&#8311;, after being absorbed, is retained in
the body less than six months and then excreted. Sr&#8313;&#8304; is retained
for many years.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Cs&sup1;&sup3;&#8311; can cause a type of damage which
Sr&#8313;&#8304; cannot cause: namely, damage to the reproductive cells.
The effect of Sr&#8313;&#8304; is indeed limited to the bones and adjacent
or nearby bone marrow, and does not reach the reproductive
organs. In a later chapter we shall take up the question of
genetic danger, and then we shall be very interested in Cs&sup1;&sup3;&#8311;.
For the remainder of this chapter, however, we may focus
our attention on Sr&#8313;&#8304;.</p>
<p>Since a large fraction of the Sr&#8313;&#8304; which enters the body stays
there, the most important questions which remain are: how it
gets there and how much gets there. The essential fact in this
connection is that the Sr&#8313;&#8304; generally occurs in the fallout in a
chemical form which is easily dissolved in water. The water
is taken up by plants, by absorption through the leaves and
the roots. Animals graze on the plants. Human beings eat the
plants and drink the milk from the grazing animals, and
thus become exposed to Sr&#8313;&#8304;. (See <a href="#fig11">pictures 5 and 6</a>.)</p>
<p>One might worry because Sr&#8313;&#8304; is not a naturally occurring
isotope but has been made for the first time by man in the
fission process. Here is an unfamiliar poison being scattered
over the earth. Can we have any idea how much will be taken
up by human beings?</p>
<p>The answer depends on a fact which we have emphasized
throughout this book: that isotopes of the same element are
chemically and biologically indistinguishable. The radioactive
variety of strontium will behave exactly like the stable
natural variety. In particular, the ratio of Sr&#8313;&#8304; to stable strontium
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
in the human body must be the same as this ratio is in
our food. From this premise we can predict how much Sr&#8313;&#8304;
will reach the human body.</p>
<p>From the total yield of fission energy released in all nuclear
tests to date, one can calculate exactly how much Sr&#8313;&#8304; has been
produced. This amount turns out to be about 100 pounds.</p>
<p>Approximately one half of this amount has been deposited
in and near the test sites in the close-in fallout. (Most of the
radioactivity comes from the big bombs, and most of these
have been burst on the ground or over shallow water.) A
small portion of the 100 pounds has disintegrated in the
cloud. The remainder, roughly 50 pounds, is partially still in
the stratosphere and partially has been disseminated around
the world in the tropospheric and stratospheric fallout. At
the present time measurements show that 25 or 30 pounds
have actually been returned to the surface of the earth. Local
values vary from about one third to more than twice the
average world-wide value.</p>
<p>In the northern part of the United States, in the regions of
frequent rainfall, the measured values are about twice the
world-wide average. In the latitudes between 10&deg;S and 50&deg;N
the average value is about 50 per cent greater than the world-wide
average. For the rest of the world one finds, with some
variations, about one third the world-wide average.</p>
<p>Most of the Sr&#8313;&#8304; fallout is caught in the top two or three
inches of the soil. It exists there in a water-soluble form that
is readily assimilated by plants. Also in the soil, chemically
inseparable from the Sr&#8313;&#8304;, is stable natural strontium. Plants,
animals, and human beings have no way of distinguishing
between the two.</p>
<p>It is not easy to determine how much natural strontium is
in a form which is available to the plants. Some of the natural
strontium is insoluble; and some is below the root depth.
Our best estimate is that there are about 60 pounds per acre
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
actually available for uptake by the plants. This is, of course,
an average.</p>
<p>The amount of natural strontium in the human body is a
quantity we know rather well. It has been carefully measured
and is about 0.7 gram in the average adult, with proportionately
less in children. Now since we know how greatly
Sr&#8313;&#8304; has been diluted in the soil and how much natural strontium
there is in our bodies, we can calculate the expected
quantity of Sr&#8313;&#8304; in our bones. Considering the many uncertainties
in the calculation one should not expect too good
an agreement. The remarkable fact is that the quantity of
Sr&#8313;&#8304; measured in small children does agree with the calculated
amount. For adults the measured value is quite a bit less than
the calculated amount because adult bones have been made
for the most part before there was any Sr&#8313;&#8304; in the environment.</p>
<p>The fact that we can calculate how much Sr&#8313;&#8304; is at present
in the body is most important because it gives us confidence
that we understand what is happening. It is especially important
for us to understand what is happening so that we
can predict how nuclear tests which are carried out today will
affect future levels of Sr&#8313;&#8304; in the body.</p>
<p>From arguments such as we have given, plus a record of
the Sr&#8313;&#8304; content of bones over the last several years, it seems
unlikely that the level of Sr&#8313;&#8304; will increase by more than a
factor of two or so due to tests already conducted. Actually
this factor may be even smaller both because of the mixing
of the strontium with the deeper layers of the soil, and because
the radioactive strontium which stays in the ground for
a long time tends to become chemically less soluble and
mixed more thoroughly with that part of the natural strontium
which is chemically unavailable. This latter process is
called &ldquo;chemical aging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To follow radioactive strontium and normal strontium
from the soil into the food and the bones is not an easy
matter. We must worry about the question of the strontium
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
depth in the soil and the chemical form of the strontium. The
complete identity of Sr&#8313;&#8304; and normal strontium holds only if
both are near the same place and in the same chemical form.
A further difficulty is that until recently little was known
about the behavior of normal strontium and knowledge is
accumulating slowly.</p>
<p>Much more is known about calcium. Now calcium and
strontium do not behave in an identical way, but they do behave
similarly. In passing from soil to man the ratio of calcium
to strontium does not remain the same but at least it
changes in a more or less definite manner. Actually most
work on Sr&#8313;&#8304; uptake has been done by comparing Sr&#8313;&#8304; with
calcium.</p>
<p>In order to use the data on calcium one has to find out
how the calcium to strontium ratio is changed when the material
is taken up into the human body. In the soil there is,
on the average, about 1 part of strontium to 100 parts of calcium.
In the human body the ratio is about 1 to 1400.</p>
<p>Thus the strontium is discriminated against relative to
calcium in going from the soil to man by a factor of about 14.
This is a factor of protection.</p>
<p>It is good to double-check this conclusion and to find out
how the calcium to strontium ratio changes step by step in
going from the soil to man. One finds a factor of 1.4 in going
from the soil to the plant, a factor of 7 in going from the plant
to the milk, and a factor of about 2 in going from the milk to
man. Actually, if we put all these factors together we should
expect that on the way from the soil to man the calcium to
strontium ratio increases by a factor 20. This is in reasonable
but not in excellent agreement with the ratio 14 given above.</p>
<p>Once the factor of protection is established we can get a
value of the expected strontium uptake from the way in
which the radioactive material is diluted by calcium rather
than by normal strontium. This is a less straightforward but,
for the time being, a more practical method than the direct
Sr&#8313;&#8304;&mdash;normal strontium comparison. It is particularly important
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
when one compares soils of rather different calcium
content.</p>
<p>Plants and animals require calcium. When they do not get
it, they develop a calcium-hunger. Since strontium is chemically
similar to calcium, a lack of calcium in the soil is readily
substituted by available strontium. One would expect that
plants grown on calcium-poor soil and animals raised on such
land would exhibit abnormally high natural strontium content
and also a proportionately high Sr&#8313;&#8304; content. The high
Sr&#8313;&#8304; content has in fact been verified. Some sheep in Wales,
for example, appear to have about ten times the average
amount of Sr&#8313;&#8304; in their bodies.</p>
<p>Fortunately most people derive their food from many areas
widely separated from each other. Soil that is deficient in
calcium is not likely to supply more than a small part of an
individual&rsquo;s sustenance. However, the possibility of a large
fluctuation cannot be ignored. In this event corrective measures
would be needed. One simple measure would be to
fertilize deficient soil with additional calcium.</p>
<p>That soil can be successfully treated in this way is illustrated
by the present situation in Wales. The sheep with the
abnormally high Sr&#8313;&#8304; content all come from the steep, poor
pastures which are not limed. The sheep from the lower pastures,
which are limed (not because of the fallout but for
economic reasons), show an activity of only one third the
value mentioned above.</p>
<p>The point we have tried to make in this chapter is that the
present human levels of Sr&#8313;&#8304; can be satisfactorily accounted
for by simple arguments based on the chemical similarity of
elements and the identity of isotopes. These arguments give
us confidence that we correctly understand how Sr&#8313;&#8304; and how
much Sr&#8313;&#8304; is getting from the soil to the human body.</p>
<p>At the same time we have seen how many factors influence
the eventual uptake into the human body: geographical latitude,
frequency of rainfall, the chemical form in which strontium
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
is found, the calcium content of the soil, the method of
agriculture. Even though the United States has pushed this
investigation vigorously since 1952 the bulk of the work is
still ahead of us.</p>
<p>For instance, in the United States, dairy products provide
most of the calcium and strontium in our diets. In Japan,
however, the situation is somewhat different. There the main
source of calcium and strontium is rice. As a result, the ratio
of strontium to calcium may be passing differently from the
soil to man. Also the fallout strontium might be washed
deeper into the soil and the soluble to non-soluble ratio
might be different.</p>
<p>Considering the complex nature of the Sr&#8313;&#8304; uptake into
man, it is important to keep close track of the actual Sr&#8313;&#8304;
levels in the soil, in our food, and in our own bodies. The following
graphs show how these levels have risen in the last
several years due to the bomb tests:</p>

<p>The actual amounts of Sr&#8313;&#8304; in the soil, in the milk, and in
the bones of young children are only approximately known.
But the main point that we are trying to illustrate, is that
since 1954 the buildup of Sr&#8313;&#8304; has gone on at a rather steady
rate. How far will this buildup continue?</p>
<p>More radioactivity was released in tests in the year 1954
than in all other years put together. Probably more than one-half
of that activity has already been deposited. Since that
time the fission energy produced in U.S. tests has steadily decreased.
Furthermore, we have learned how to minimize the
world-wide fallout by employing ground bursts which deposit
most of their activity in the close-in fallout near the
test site. It is also possible to place chemical additives near the
bomb in order to convert the strontium into a more insoluble
form or else into a form which will more readily fall out in
the immediate neighborhood of the explosion. And what is
most important&mdash;we are developing clean nuclear weapons,
which produce blast and heat but greatly reduced radioactivity.
In the future these clean weapons may eliminate the
additional radioactivity altogether.</p>
<p>It is hard to make predictions about the plans of all nations.
If we find&mdash;and others also find&mdash;that clean weapons
are the most desirable, the total strontium contamination is
not likely to become more than perhaps two to four times the
present value. We believe that all reasons&mdash;respect for human
life, military considerations and simple sanity&mdash;lead to
one conclusion. In the development of nuclear explosives we
must endeavor to make them clean. But the real reason for
this does not lie in the small contamination due to tests. The
real reason is that war could turn contamination into a danger
to countless people.</p>

<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br />Danger to the Individual</h2>
<p>How much harm is being done by the atomic
tests? Some scientists have claimed that from past tests alone
about 50,000 persons throughout the world will die prematurely.
There is no general agreement on this point. Some
think the number should be smaller. It is possible that radioactivity
produces some effects which prolong life rather than
shorten it. But even if all the biological consequences of radiation
were known many questions would still demand answers.
Can tests be justified if they actually shorten some human
lives? Even the possibility of a health hazard must be
taken most seriously. On the other hand: Are there any reasons
which make continued testing necessary?</p>
<p>We shall return to these questions in a later chapter. First,
however, we shall try to put before the reader the known facts
about the fallout danger to the individual. We shall try to
put this danger into perspective by relating it to other more
familiar dangers to which all of us are exposed. In the following
chapter we shall discuss how the fallout may affect
future generations.</p>
<p>The dangers from big doses of radiation are well known.
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
Exposure to a thousand roentgens over our whole body
causes almost certain death in less than thirty days. Four or
five hundred roentgens give a fifty-fifty chance of survival. At
less than a hundred roentgens, there is no danger of immediate
death. Three years ago the Marshallese got a dose of 175
roentgens. None died. Apparently all are in good health.</p>
<p>Over longer periods of time even bigger radiation doses
can be tolerated. A thousand roentgens spread over a lifetime
produce no apparent biological consequences in individual
cases. A rough rule (which is not too well-established)
is that five times as much radiation can be tolerated if one is
exposed to only a little radiation at any one time.</p>
<p>A hundred roentgens all at once, or several times this
amount over a protracted time period, will not cause sickness
or death that can be directly blamed on the radiation. However,
such a dose of radiation may have harmful biological
consequences which are more subtle. An exposed individual
may develop an increased susceptibility to certain diseases,
notably bone cancer and leukemia. Leukemia is a fatal disease
in which the white blood cells multiply too rapidly.</p>
<p>A person who receives a hundred roentgens does not necessarily
contract bone cancer or leukemia. Rather, his chance
of contracting these diseases during his lifetime may have
been increased. Knowledge of this kind can be obtained only
with the help of statistics.</p>
<p>If, for example, a large number of mice receive a heavy
dosage of radiation over a long period of time, one finds that
the incidence of tumors and leukemia is higher amongst such
irradiated animals than the natural incidence of these diseases.</p>
<p>Direct evidence with human beings&mdash;fortunately&mdash;is rather
scarce. Statistics exist on the survivors of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, and also on radiologists. The latter group probably
receive several hundred roentgens during their professional
lifetimes. In addition, some statistics exist on children who
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
have been treated with large doses of radiation for enlarged
thymuses. Persons suffering from ankylosing spondylitis,
which is a painful disease of the spinal joints, have also been
treated with large X-ray doses. The statistics in all these cases
lead to the same conclusion: that large doses of radiation increase
the likelihood that an individual&rsquo;s life will be shortened
by leukemia and possibly also other cancers. Furthermore,
it appears (mainly from the experiments on animals)
that the increased likelihood is simply proportional to the
amount of radiation received, at least for doses in the neighborhood
of several hundred roentgens or so.</p>
<p>This of course sounds frightening. But the radiation doses
from the world-wide fallout are in a completely different
class from those we have been discussing. They are very
much smaller. On the average human bones are getting about
0.002 roentgens per year from the Sr&#8313;&#8304; in the fallout. In addition
the whole body is receiving a roughly equal amount in
gamma rays, mainly from Cs&sup1;&sup3;&#8311;. These figures apply to new
bone in young children who have grown up in an environment
of Sr&#8313;&#8304; in the northern part of the United States. This
is a region of maximum fallout. Adults whose bones were
made for the most part before the atomic testing started are
getting about 0.0003 roentgens per year from Sr&#8313;&#8304;. None of
these figures appears to be alarming.</p>
<p>At this present rate a lifetime dosage in northern U.S. is
only a small fraction of a roentgen. A rare individual might
get several times this amount. If tests continue at the present
rate, radiation levels could increase by as much as five-fold.
However, even in this situation it is difficult to imagine anyone
receiving a lifetime dose of more than five or ten roentgens
from the world-wide fallout. A more reasonable estimate
for the average lifetime dose would be a few roentgens or less.</p>
<p>One might conclude from these figures that there is no danger
whatsoever from the fallout. This conclusion, however,
may not be correct.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>The danger from such small doses of radiation is not easy
to define. Even the best statistical methods are insufficient.
One is looking for small effects which show up only after
millions of cases have been studied. Animal experiments are
extremely difficult to carry out under these conditions. Direct
controlled experience with human beings is, of course, impossible.
As a result, one is forced to draw conclusions from
the effects at higher dose levels, where experimental data
have been obtained.</p>
<p>This may be done in many ways. One way is to assume that
the law of proportionality holds down to the smallest doses.
This means that one roentgen produces one hundredth as
many cases of bone cancer and leukemia as 100 roentgens
produce. This law is plausible. It is by no means proven.</p>
<p>By arguing in this way one finds that for each megaton of
fission energy which escapes from the test site in the world-wide
fallout the lives of approximately four hundred persons
would be shortened by leukemia or bone cancer. Under present
conditions of testing, roughly one half of the fission
products are deposited as close-in fallout in and near the test
site. Per megaton of fission energy exploded, therefore, perhaps
200 persons may get leukemia or bone cancer. This
figure could actually be higher, possibly even a thousand persons
or more per megaton. It could also be lower. It could be
zero.</p>
<p>It is possible that radiation of less than a certain intensity
does not cause bone cancer or leukemia at all. In the past
small doses of radiation have often been regarded as beneficial.
This was not supported by any scientific evidence. Today
many well-informed people believe that radiation is harmful
even in the smallest amounts. This statement has been
repeated in an authoritative manner. Actually there can be
little doubt that radiation hurts the individual cell. But a
living being is a most complex thing. Damage to a small fraction
of the cells might be beneficial to the whole organism.
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
Some experiments on mice seem to show that exposure to a
little radiation increases the life expectancy of the animals.
Scientific truth is firm&mdash;when it is complete. The evidence of
what a little radiation will do to a complex animal like a
human being is in an early and uncertain state.</p>
<p>In any event the number of additional cases of leukemia
and bone cancer due to the fallout radiation is certainly too
small to be noticed against the natural incidence of these disorders.</p>
<p>In the next thirty years about 6,000,000 people throughout
the world will die from leukemia and bone cancer. From past
tests, which have involved the explosion of about fifty megatons
of fission energy, the possibility exists that another 50 &times;
200, i.e., 10,000 cases may occur. Statistical methods are not
able to find the difference between 6,000,000 and 6,010,000.
There is no way to differentiate between the fallout-induced
cases of leukemia and bone cancer, and those which occur
naturally.</p>
<p>The possible shortening of ten thousand lives may seem
rather ominous. But mere figures can be misleading. A better
way to appreciate the danger from fallout is to compare it
with other more familiar dangers. Such a comparison can be
made with the natural background of cosmic rays and radioactivity
in the earth and in our own bodies.</p>
<p>We are constantly and inescapably exposed to this radiation.
Our ancestors have been exposed to it. The human race
has evolved in such a radioactive environment. Moreover, the
biological effects from different kinds of radiation can be
compared in a meaningful way in terms of roentgens. Therefore
the danger from Sr&#8313;&#8304; is not unknown in every respect. In
some ways it is very well-known because we and all living
beings have spent our days in a similarly dangerous surrounding.
We live on an earth which has radioactivity in its rocks,
which carries a similar activity in its waters, and which is exposed
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
from all sides, to a rain of particles which produce effects
identical with the effects of radioactive materials.</p>
<p>Not all radiations which have the same intensity (the same
number of roentgens) have precisely the same effect. The
damage produced also depends somewhat on the spacing of
the ionized and disrupted molecules. The cosmic rays and the
Sr&#8313;&#8304;, however, are quite similar even in this respect.</p>
<p>The reader will recall that the spacing of the ionization
depends only on the charge and the speed of the ionizing particle.
The ionizing particle from the Sr&#8313;&#8304; is an energetic beta
ray, which has a charge of one and a speed close to that of
light. A large part of the background radiation which reaches
our bones comes from the cosmic rays. The main portion of
the cosmic rays is due to the mesons. The meson, like the
beta ray, has a unit charge and a speed close to that of light.
The two particles may therefore be expected to produce
identical biological effects. The only difference between their
effects is that the beta ray does not have enough energy to
leave the bones, while the meson is so energetic that it deposits
its energy both in our bones and throughout our whole
body. Thus if we compare a Sr&#8313;&#8304; dose with the same dose of
cosmic rays the same effect to the bones must be expected. But
the cosmic rays give rise to additional effects in our bodies.</p>
<p>The total background dose to the bones is about 0.15 roentgens
per year for the average person living at sea level in
the United States. Of this amount, about 0.035 roentgens is
due to cosmic rays. At higher altitudes the cosmic ray dosage
increases. In Denver, at an altitude of 5000 feet, the cosmic
rays contribute 0.05 roentgens per year.</p>
<p>The above numbers should be compared with the present
level of world-wide fallout radiation to the bones: about
0.003 roentgens per year (from Sr&#8313;&#8304; and other sources). The
fallout radiation is thus only a few per cent of the natural
cosmic radiation. It is small even when compared to the variation
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
of cosmic ray intensity between sea level and 5000 feet.</p>
<p>A correlation between the frequency of leukemia and bone
cancer, and the intensity of natural radiation has been looked
for. Some statistics for the year 1947, before weapons testing
began, are available. They show the number of cases of these
diseases occurring in that year per 100,000 population.</p>
<table class="center">
<tr class="th"><th> </th><th><i>Bone Cancer</i> </th><th><i>Leukemia</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Denver </td><td class="r">2.4 </td><td class="r">6.4</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">New Orleans </td><td class="r">2.8 </td><td class="r">6.9</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">San Francisco </td><td class="r">2.9 </td><td class="r">10.3</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The extra radiation that one gets in Denver from cosmic
rays is many times greater than the fallout radiation. But the
table shows no increased incidence of bone cancer or leukemia.
On the contrary&mdash;the incidence of these diseases is
actually lower in Denver.</p>
<p>Not all of the natural background radiation is due to cosmic
rays. Part of the background comes from natural radioactive
elements in the soil and in the drinking water. These
include uranium, potassium&#8308;&#8304;, thorium and radium. Radium
behaves like calcium and strontium, and gets deposited in
our bones. All these effects are, to the best of our knowledge,
at least as intensive in the Denver area as in San Francisco
or New Orleans.</p>
<p>One possible explanation for the lower incidence of bone
cancer and leukemia in Denver is that disruptive processes
like radiation are not necessarily harmful in small enough
doses. Cell deterioration and regrowth go on all the time
in living creatures. A slight acceleration of these processes
could conceivably be beneficial to the organism. One should
not forget that while radiation can cause cancer, it has been
used in massive doses to retard and sometimes even to cure
cancer. The reason is that some cancer cells are more strongly
damaged by radiation than the normal cells.</p>
<p>In spite of the table, however, there may actually be an
increased tendency toward bone cancer and leukemia that
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
results from living in Denver. If so&mdash;and this is the main
point&mdash;the effect is too small to be noticed compared to other
effects. We must remember that Denver differs from New
Orleans and San Francisco in many ways (besides altitude),
and these differences may also influence the statistics.</p>
<p>A more thorough consideration of the background radiation
gives further evidence that this radiation is more important
than the present or expected effects of Sr&#8313;&#8304;. The radium
deposited in our bones from drinking water has been
observed to reach values as high as 0.55 roentgens per year.
Furthermore the heavier and slower alpha particles emitted
by radium cause ionization processes which occur in closer
spacing and are therefore more damaging than the ionization
due to Sr&#8313;&#8304;. To make things worse radium is deposited
in our bones in little nodules (hot spots). Thus the possibility
of local damage is enhanced.</p>
<p>The background radiation to which we are exposed varies
for some unexpected reasons. It has been pointed out recently
that brick may contain more natural radioactivity than
wood. The difference between living in a brick house and
living in a wood house could give rise to ten times as much
radiation as we are currently getting from fallout. (The additional
radiation from the brick might be as much as 0.03
roentgens per year.)</p>
<p>Human beings are subject to radiation not only from
natural sources, but also from man-made sources. One of
these is wearing a wrist watch with a luminous dial. Another
is having X-rays for medical purposes. Both of these sources
give much more radiation than the fallout.</p>
<p>Of all ionizing radiation to which we are exposed the
X-rays are most important. In some cases medical X-rays have
intensities which are noticeably harmful. Yet this damage is
practically always of little consequence compared to the advantage
from correct recognition of any trouble that the X-ray
discloses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>We may summarize in this way. Our knowledge of the
effects from the fallout is deficient. We cannot say exactly
how many lives may be impaired or shortened. On the other
hand, our knowledge is sufficient to state that the fallout
effect is below the statistically observable limit. It is also
considerably less than the effect produced by moving from
sea level to an elevated location like Denver, where cosmic
radiation has a greater intensity. It is also less than having
a chest X-ray every year. In other words, we know enough
to state positively that the danger from the world-wide fallout
is less than many other radiation effects which have not worried
people and do not worry them now.</p>
<p>We have compared radiation from the fallout with radiation
from other sources. It is also possible and helpful to
compare the fallout danger with different kinds of dangers.
For this purpose it is convenient to express all dangers in
terms of a reduced life-expectancy. For example, smoking
one pack of cigarettes a day seems to cut one&rsquo;s life-expectancy
by about 9 years. This is equivalent to 15 minutes per cigarette.
That cigarettes are this harmful is, of course, not known
with certainty. It is a &ldquo;best guess,&rdquo; due to Dr. Hardin Jones,
based on an analysis of statistical data. A number of Dr.
Jones&rsquo; statistical findings are listed in the following table:<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></p>
<table class="center">
<tr class="th"><th> </th><th><i>Reduced Life Expectancy</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Being 10 per cent overweight </td><td class="r">1.5 years</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Smoking one pack of cigarettes a day </td><td class="r">9 years</td></tr>

<tr><td class="l">The world-wide fallout (lifetime dose at present level) </td><td class="r">1 to 2 days</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The reader will see that the world-wide fallout is as dangerous
as being an ounce overweight or smoking one cigarette
every two months.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>The objection may be raised that the fallout, while not
yet dangerous, may become so as more nations develop and
test atomic weapons. On this point we can only say that the
future is not easy to predict. Some factors, however, justify
optimism. We are learning how to regulate the fallout by
exploding bombs under proper surroundings. Development
of clean bombs will greatly reduce the radioactivity produced.
Deep underground tests will eliminate fallout altogether.
The activity put into the atmosphere in 1954 was
considerably greater than the activity released in any other
year. It is highly probable that the activity produced by
United States tests will continue to decline.</p>
<p>Finally, we may remark that radiation is unspecific in its
effects. Chemicals are specific. About the effects of a new
ingredient in our diet, in our medicine, or in the air we
breathe, we know much less than we know about radiation.
If we should worry about our ignorance concerning our
chemical surroundings as we worry about the possible effects
of radiation, we would be condemned to a conservatism that
would stop all change and stifle all progress. Such conservatism
would be more immobile than the empire of the Pharaohs.</p>
<p>It has been claimed that it is wrong to endanger any human
life. Is it not more realistic and in fact more in keeping with
the ideals of humanitarianism to strive toward a better life
for all mankind?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />Danger to the Race</h2>
<p>Radiation may hurt the individual. It may also
be harmful for our children and hurt the race. We have seen
that the danger from the radiation due to testing is small
compared to many risks which we habitually take and almost
always ignore, which in fact we have to ignore to continue to
live in this civilized world. In addition we are not even quite
sure that the danger to the individual is real.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt, however, that radiation does
produce some harmful changes in our children. What seems
even more frightening, is that these changes may not show
up in our children but only in their children or further
progeny. A danger which may lie hidden for generations
might seem more terrifying, especially as it has often been
repeated that all such radiation effects are harmful.</p>
<p>We transmit our properties to coming generations in a
most curious and concentrated fashion. From the mother and
the father a child inherits a number of chromosomes, twenty-four
from each.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> These are structures along which the actual
carriers of the properties&mdash;the genes&mdash;are strung up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>We are beginning to understand something about the nature
of the genes. They seem to be very big spiral molecules.
They carry the master plan of our body and even of our character
in a strange chemical code.</p>
<p>The laws of heredity are complicated because of the fact
that the same property is influenced by a gene from each
parent. Frequently these two genes dictate different behavior
and then the result is a compromise, sometimes evenhanded,
sometimes unbalanced. But of the two genes only one will
find its way to the child of the next generation. The compromise
is temporary and original properties may emerge
again. Which one of any pair of chromosomes (or of the two
assemblies of genes) carries on is a matter of chance. In the
world of the cells as in the world of atoms it is chance that
determines the future&mdash;not fate.</p>
<p>Of all these facts we need be particularly interested in one.
The units of inheritance are rather constant but not quite
immutable. There is a small possibility that any gene may
suffer a mutation. That is, it may turn into a new chemical,
carrying a new code and new properties.</p>
<p>A gene is an extremely finely and precisely constituted object.
It must be so in order to carry all the racial past in so
little material. A mutation due to chance will spoil this order
in almost every instance. The great majority of mutations are
detrimental. Many are lethal.</p>
<p>It is an incredible fact that these random mutations, almost
always harmful and never proceeding according to any plan,
should have been responsible in the very long run for all the
many beautiful and perfect living creatures that nature has
produced (and this includes the human race). The thread
leading from single cells to cell colonies, worms, fishes, vertebrates,
mammals and human beings does certainly not seem
to be the work of chance. Much less does it seem to be the
work of a gamble taking one chance of a small improvement
against a thousand chances of deformity or death. Nevertheless
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
it is such a terrible game of chance which has produced
both the human body and in some manner also the human
spirit.</p>
<p>Big numbers are strange things and when each member of
a huge assembly must be given individual attention then
the numbers are even harder to appreciate. Billions of contemporary
lives in billions of distinct generations have led
to the incredible outcome: the harmony of life produced by
gambling.</p>
<p>Radiation is surely disruptive. It does cause mutations.
Since the genes appear to be single molecules, a single process
of ionization or excitation is likely to result in a change. As
has been said before there is doubt whether or not cancer
and leukemia can be caused by exceedingly little radiation.
There is little doubt, however, that mutations can be caused
by any small amount of radiation. The less radiation the less
the chance. But the chance will always be there.</p>
<p>A very great increase in the natural rate of mutations could
indeed have terrifying effects. We can be quite certain, however,
that radiation from atomic tests will increase the chance
of mutations by only a very small amount.</p>
<p>The argument is essentially the same as the one concerning
the danger to the individual. The tests are responsible for
0.001 or 0.002 roentgens per year to the human reproductive
cells. This is equivalent to approximately 0.05 roentgen per
generation. Most of this radiation is due to gamma rays from
Cs&sup1;&sup3;&#8311; which has been deposited on the ground or absorbed
in the body. The number of mutations caused by this radiation
is to be compared with the number of natural mutations.</p>
<p>Some of the natural mutations are caused by heat and
chemicals. Some are due to background radiation, to cosmic
rays or to gamma and beta rays emitted by natural radioactive
substances in or near our bodies. Our best estimate is that 10
per cent of the natural mutations are due to the background
radiation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Over a period of one generation the background radiation
dosage to the human reproductive cells is approximately five
roentgens. Assuming a simple proportionality between dosage
and the number of mutations, it follows that fifty roentgens
would be required to induce a number of mutations
equal to the total number of natural mutations (from background
radiation and all other causes). That is, fifty roentgens
is a &ldquo;doubling dose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The atomic tests are therefore increasing the number of
mutations by about 0.05 &divide; 50, which is 0.1 per cent. This
kind of increase in the rate of mutations would certainly not
seem to be a serious reason for worry.</p>
<p>Actually the number of mutations from the tests is very
small even compared to geographical and altitude variations
in the natural radioactivity. The Inca empire existed for
many generations in the high country of Peru. The people
of Tibet have been exposed for generation after generation
to the greater cosmic ray intensity which bombards them
through a thinner layer of atmosphere. These people have
been exposed to much greater additional radiation than anything
which is caused by atomic tests. Yet genetic differences
have not been noticed in the human race or for that matter in
any other living species in Peru or Tibet. We are certainly
talking here about questions which may strike hard on some
individuals but which from the point of view of the community
or race are not serious.</p>
<p>It has been often repeated that all mutations due to radiation
are harmful. There is every reason to believe that mutations
due to radiation are not different in kind from other
mutations. Should we then seriously believe that all mutations
are harmful? That most of them are is admitted. If all
of them were indeed always harmful, we must deny the simplest
facts of evolution.</p>
<p>There will be some who maintain that the human race
is not capable of improvement. Such an argument is irrefutable.
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
It is also unreasonable. What cannot be further improved
is perfect, and not many people will maintain that
our species can claim perfection.</p>
<p>Another and much more plausible argument has been
advanced: In the wild state living species do perfect themselves
by means of natural selection. Human society by caring
for the imperfect and defective individual has eliminated
natural selection. Therefore further mutations will not improve
mankind.</p>
<p>It is very hard to discuss this question for the simple reason
that the argument involves the interaction of two processes
extremely different in magnitude and in fact different in
kind. On the one hand it concerns itself with evolution
which proceeds in the slow deliberate way of a glacier. On
the other hand it focuses attention upon the process of human
civilization with its technical and social changes which
has gained momentum like an avalanche. The momentum is
still there and it is still increasing and where we shall land
we do not know. To consider the motion of the glacier while
being carried along by the avalanche puts things completely
out of proportion. Long before the present rates of mutation
could have any effect upon the human species we shall live
in a very different world and we shall have started to influence
our own behavior including those of selection, natural
or otherwise, in ways which today we cannot foresee.</p>
<p>If we discuss the question how civilization will influence
natural selection, we shall not do it with the hope of arriving
at a firm answer. We shall do it rather in order to illustrate
how doubtful all the arguments are which concern the interplay
of two processes which cannot be measured in the same
scale.</p>
<p>It is true that we can and do preserve the lives of children
who, because of inherited weaknesses, would perish under
natural conditions. It is true too that we do this for reasons
and for feelings concerning the individual and we do it without
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
regard to the consequences to the race. However, under
our present condition of civilization a disease which can be
corrected by administering chemicals or using the surgeon&rsquo;s
knife is no longer effectively a disease. In our present condition
such a life can be as valuable to society and to the race
as a life which does not have these superficial shortcomings.
That we can and do preserve more life in this manner only
emphasizes that under present conditions biological differences
which used to be important no longer matter.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in social living many properties which
used to be indifferent for a wild being have become of great
significance. Ability to communicate and to get along with
our fellows is not the only one, but is perhaps the most obvious
one of such properties. The struggle for existence has
become more gentle, and the chance of any individual to live
on in his children is governed by new ways of behavior.
Nevertheless the difference between the individual adapted
to civilized living and the one who is not adapted is of great
importance and will become of greater importance. It is
likely that civilization will not eliminate evolution of the
race. Rather it will direct it into new paths.</p>
<p>But the greatest change might be expected from an entirely
different direction. We are going to understand in real detail
the intricacies of human inheritance. Then we shall be faced
with problems and shall find possibilities of an entirely new
and different kind. The interest of a person in his children
is not a superficial one. It is one of the most strong and lasting
forces in biology, sociology and history. A clear understanding
of the details of inheritance may bring about some
grave difficulties because a new situation is never fitted easily
into existing patterns of living. In the end more understanding
may bring about improvements of a kind beside which
all the worthwhile things that have been so far accomplished,
might look unimportant.</p>
<p>The real importance of radioactivity for heredity does not
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
lie in the fact that we may speed up the glacier by one inch
in a millennium. The real importance of nuclear radiation
is rather that it is helping us to understand the strange processes
of life and the curious substances which connect one
generation to the next.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />The Cobalt Bomb</h2>
<p>Nuclear explosions seem horrible for many
reasons. They were presented to an unprepared world as a
dramatic surprise&mdash;as the climax to the slaughter of the Second
World War. Their power of destruction is fantastic.
Before we had adjusted our thinking to atomic bombs, an
even more potent tool of warfare&mdash;the hydrogen bomb&mdash;was
invented. Worst of all: To the fear of destruction there was
added the dread of the unknown. It is not surprising that
discussion of nuclear weapons has not proceeded on a purely
rational level.</p>
<p>To the nightmare of the atomic and hydrogen bombs has
been added&mdash;not as a reality but as a further threat&mdash;the
cobalt bomb. The idea of such a bomb is to intensify the
most terrifying aspect of nuclear explosions: the radioactivity.
This radioactivity could be used to poison the enemy.
It could get out of hand and poison everyone.</p>
<p>Cobalt&#8310;&#8304; is a radioactive isotope of the fairly common
metal cobalt. It can be easily produced by absorbing slow neutrons
in the natural and stable cobalt&#8309;&#8313;. It has a half-life of
five years and it emits penetrating gamma rays. These properties
make it useful in cancer therapy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Many cancerous growths are more sensitive to radiation
than healthy tissue. Therefore radiation can be used to reduce&mdash;sometimes
even to destroy&mdash;dangerous tumors. The
penetrating rays of cobalt&#8310;&#8304; can reach the cancer even deep
inside the human body. The lifetime of cobalt&#8310;&#8304; is long
enough so that this substance is easily installed in hospitals.</p>
<p>But the same properties which make cobalt&#8310;&#8304; useful also
make it potentially dangerous. A nuclear explosion produces
many neutrons and these could be absorbed in ordinary cobalt.
The radioactivity produced in this way lives long
enough to become widely distributed. Its ray can easily penetrate
a foot of masonry and several hundred feet of air. A
cobalt bomb would indeed be a most unpleasant object. (See
<a href="#fig13">pictures 7 and 8</a>.)</p>
<p>One widely discussed possibility is that future nuclear tests
will be used to develop a cobalt bomb or other bombs for
radiological warfare. Actually tests have little to do with the
cobalt bomb. Once one has a powerful nuclear weapon, such
as a hydrogen bomb, it is relatively easy to make a radiological
bomb. Further tests are not necessarily required. To the
extent that any testing need be carried out, it is only necessary
to activate a moderate amount of substance to find out in
what way a certain bomb would function as a tool of radiological
warfare. Tests of this kind would add only a negligible
amount of radioactivity to the atmosphere. Therefore,
in connection with the test program we need not worry about
the cobalt bomb or any related experiment. The question of
the cobalt bomb or radiological warfare in general is not
whether it is feasible&mdash;it is&mdash;but rather whether it serves a
useful military purpose.</p>
<p>It is not impossible that situations might arise in which
radiological warfare could be militarily advantageous. Instead
of cobalt, other materials may be placed near the nuclear
bombs. In this way other radioactive substances can be
produced. By an appropriate choice of such a substance one
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
can get a radioactive material which, when deposited near
the point of explosion, will contaminate the site for a time
which can be adjusted to the military requirements. The
lifetime of the radioactive material may be long enough to
give an opportunity to the people to escape from the contaminated
area. At the same time, one may precipitate almost all
the activity near the explosion so that distant localities would
not be seriously affected. It is conceivable, therefore, that
radiological warfare could be used in a humane manner. By
exploding a weapon of this kind near an island one might be
able to force evacuation without loss of human life. No instrument,
not even a weapon, is evil in itself. Everything depends
on the way in which it is used.</p>
<p>Public opinion has all but persuaded itself that nuclear
weapons will be used not for a military objective but to terrorize
and kill the greatest number of people. This is technically
feasible. In fact, it does not even require the atomic
bomb. For the last hundred years this possibility has been
with us. Bacteriological warfare may cause widespread destruction.
Yet no one has resorted to this horrible way of
making war. We do not believe that anyone will expose his
enemy and ultimately himself to indiscriminate bacteriological
or radiological destruction. Our guarantee against this
danger is not that it cannot be done. Our guarantee is the
better and saner part of human nature: the will to survive
and the feeling of common decency.</p>

<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br />What About Future Tests?</h2>
<p>Many people feel that tests should be discontinued.
This feeling is widespread and strong. The question
of tests is obviously important. It may influence our security
as individuals. It certainly will influence our security as a
nation. If in a free, democratic country the majority believes
that something should be done&mdash;it will be done. The sovereign
power in a democracy is &ldquo;the people.&rdquo; It is of the
greatest importance that the people should be honestly and
completely informed about all relevant facts. In no other way
can a sound decision be reached. The basic and relevant facts
are simple. The story can be presented without unnecessary
frills or undue emotion. When this has been done, the right
decision will be reached by common sense rather than by
exceptional cleverness.</p>
<p>Unfortunately much of the discussion about continued experimentation
with nuclear explosives has been carried out
in a most emotional and confused manner. One argument
concerning tests is so fantastic that it deserves to be mentioned
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
for that very reason: It has been claimed that nuclear
explosions may change the axis of the earth.</p>
<p>Of course, nuclear explosions do produce such changes.
Only the changes are so small that they are impossible to
observe and even difficult to estimate. Searching for effects
connected with past tests that may displace the axis of the
earth, or the position of the North Pole, we could find no
effect that would have caused a change of position even as
great as the size of an atom. One could design tests with the
specific purpose to produce such a change, but these man-made
effects could not be compared even remotely with the
forces of nature. The motion of the Gulf Stream has a small
effect on the North Pole; but this effect is incomparably
greater than what any nuclear explosion could accomplish.
It is good to know that the old top on which we live does
have some stability.</p>
<p>The argument about world-wide radioactive fallout is
more serious. It is asserted that fallout is dangerous and that
we are ignorant of the extent of the danger.</p>
<p>In a narrow, literal sense both these statements are correct.
But in the preceding chapters we have seen that the danger is
limited. We do not know precisely how great it is. We do
know, however, that the danger is considerably smaller than
the danger from other radiations to which we continue to
expose ourselves without worry. The danger from the tests
is quite small compared with the effects of X-rays used in
medical practice. The fallout produces only a fraction of the
increase in cosmic ray effect to which a person subjects himself
when he moves from the seashore to a place of higher
altitude like Colorado. People may or may not be damaged
by the fallout. But it is quite certain that the damage is far
below a level of which we usually take notice.</p>
<p>Fallout in the vicinity of the test sites did cause damage.
In the past this damage was not great although in one Pacific
test it was serious. Precautions have been increased and
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
we may hope that future accidents will be avoided altogether.
The safety record of the Atomic Energy Commission compares
favorably with other enterprises of similar scale.</p>
<p>It seems probable that the root of the opposition to further
tests is not connected with fallout. The root is deeper. The
real reason against further tests is connected with our desire
for disarmament and for peace.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the desire for peace is most
deep, and this desire is felt by all thinking and honest people
on our earth. All of us certainly hope that the catastrophe of
war can be avoided. This great and universal wish for peace
is the driving force behind the desire for disarmament. In
the minds of most people it would be an important step
toward disarmament if the testing of nuclear weapons were
stopped by all nations. This belief is widely held, but it is
not necessarily well-founded. In fact, there are arguments on
the other side which should be considered carefully.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the First World War was
caused by an arms race. For some strange reason most people
forget that the Second World War was brought about by a
situation which could be called a race in disarmament. The
peace-loving and powerful nations divested themselves of
their military power. When the Nazi regime in Germany
adopted a program of rapid preparation for war, the rest of
the world was caught unawares. At first they did not want
to accept the fact of this menace. When the danger was unmistakable,
it was too late to avert a most cruel war, and
almost too late to stop Hitler short of world conquest. Unfortunately,
disarmament is safe only when no one wants
to impose his will by force of arms upon his neighbors.</p>
<p>In the uneasy world in which we live today no reasonable
person will advocate unilateral disarmament. What people
hope is that all sides will agree to reduce their military power
and thereby contribute to a more peaceful atmosphere. The
elimination of tests has appeared possible and proper for two
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
reasons. One is that tests are conspicuous, and therefore it is
believed that we can check whether or not testing has actually
been stopped by everyone. The second reason is that
nuclear explosives already represent such terrifying power
that further tests appear useless and irrational. These arguments
are simple and almost universally accepted. They are
based on misconceptions.</p>
<p>A nuclear explosion is a violent event, but in the great
expanses of our globe such tests can be effectively hidden if
appropriate care is taken to hide them. There can be no
doubt that this is possible. The question is only how much
it costs to hide a test and how big is the explosion that can
be carried out in secret for a certain amount of expenditure.</p>
<p>If an agreement were made to discontinue the tests, the
United States would surely keep such an agreement. The very
social and political structure of our country excludes the possibility
that many people would collaborate in breaking an
international undertaking. Whether Russia would or would
not keep such an agreement would depend on the ingenuity
of the Russians, on their willingness to make economic sacrifices,
and on their honesty. Of these three factors we can
have a firm opinion about the first. The Russians are certainly
ingenious enough to devise secret methods of testing.
As to the other questions, whether the Russians will want to
invest the effort and whether they will be bound by their
word, we feel that each man is entitled to his own opinion.
According to past experience, an agreement to stop tests may
well be followed by secret and successful tests behind the iron
curtain.</p>
<p>In a more general way we may ask the question: Is it wise
to make agreements which honesty will respect, but dishonesty
can circumvent? Shall we put a free, democratic government
at a disadvantage compared to the absolute power of a
dictatorship? Shall we introduce prohibition in a new form,
just to give rise to bootlegging on a much greater scale? It
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
is almost certain that in the competition between prohibition
and bootlegging, the bootlegger will win.</p>
<p>All of these arguments, however, would become irrelevant
if it were true that further testing would not accomplish any
further desirable result. It has been said and often repeated
that we now possess adequate nuclear explosives to wipe out
the cities of any enemy. What more do we need?</p>
<p>Our main purpose in further experimentation with nuclear
bombs is not, of course, to make city-busters more horrible.
We would prefer not to have to use our nuclear weapons
at all. We keep them as a counterthreat against the
danger that we ourselves should be subjected to a devastating
attack. To understand what we are actually trying to do in
the tests, we have to take a closer look at some military
problems.</p>
<p>In the Second World War strategic bombing was used for
the first time on a really massive scale. It may well be and,
in fact, it is probable that such strategic bombing will not
be repeated in the future.</p>
<p>There are two military reasons for the bombing of cities.
One is that factories are located in cities, and these factories
support the war effort. The other reason is that cities are
centers of transportation through which the supplies of war
materials pass. By destroying these centers the flow of the war
supplies can be interrupted.</p>
<p>Nuclear warfare is likely to be quite different from past
conflicts. The great concentration of firepower which a nuclear
weapon represents makes it possible to attack on enemy
anywhere, at very short notice. This is true no matter what
the particular target is, whether one is trying to attack the
planes, ships, tanks, or troop concentrations of an enemy. The
great mobility of nuclear firepower makes it highly probable
that the nuclear conflict will be short. What the factory produces
during this conflict will not affect the outcome of the
fighting. The only weapons on which anyone can rely are
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
the weapons which are already stockpiled. Therefore, it will
be militarily useless to bomb factories.</p>
<p>The same fact of mobility also implies that no great flow
of war material will need to be maintained. Practically all
movement can be executed by light and fast methods, by
planes, submarines, and small battle groups. Under these
conditions the cities will lose their importance as centers of
transportation.</p>
<p>The only purpose in bombing cities will be to spread terror
among the enemy. This was rarely done in past wars. In
fact, terror is self-defeating because it provokes retaliation
from the other side.</p>
<p>We believe that the role of nuclear weapons in a future
war is by no means the killing of millions of civilians. It is
rather to stop the armed forces of an aggressor. This is not
easy to do because it requires not only nuclear weapons, but
very special kinds of nuclear weapons which are hard to develop
and harder to perfect. But with proper experimentation
and proper planning the defensive use of nuclear weapons
is possible.</p>
<p>The idea of tactical nuclear weapons is not new. The possibility
of using nuclear explosives in small wars has been
frequently discussed. What kind of weapons do we need in
order to fight these small wars and to defend the freedom of
people wherever such defense becomes necessary? It has often
been suggested that in small wars, small weapons will be
used, while big weapons are appropriate for big wars. Such
a statement is much too simple and has no relation to reality.
In every case the right kind of weapon is the one which performs
the job of stopping the enemy&rsquo;s armed forces without
inflicting unnecessary loss on the innocent bystander. For
this purpose we need a great number of weapons which are
adaptable to specific purposes, which are easy to transport
and easy to deliver, and give rise to the kind of effect which
the situation requires.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>For instance, a nuclear weapon may be carried by a fighter
plane and used to shoot down an attacking bomber. Since the
carrying capacity of the fighter plane is severely limited, the
weapon for this purpose must be small and light. A major
objective of the test program is to develop such purely defensive
weapons.</p>
<p>The encounter between the fighter plane and the bomber
may well take place in our own country over populated areas.
This possibility would fill most people with alarm lest the
population underneath the explosion should be hurt. Fortunately,
in a recent nuclear test in Nevada, five well-informed
and courageous Air Force officers demonstrated that there is
complete safety to people on the ground. They did this by
standing directly beneath the explosion at ground zero.</p>
<p>This important test took place only a few months ago&mdash;on
July 19, 1957. An F-89 jet fighter plane flying at 19,000
feet above sea level delivered an air-to-air atomic rocket to a
preassigned point in the sky. The ground zero men were
15,000 feet immediately below. They wore no helmets, no
sun-glasses, and no protective clothing.</p>
<p>At the instant of the explosion the men looked up, saw
the fireball and felt the heat. There was no discomfort, only
a gentle warmth. Then they waited for the shock wave to
arrive&mdash;approximately ten seconds. When the shock came,
it was actually just a loud noise. However, one of the men
ducked his head instinctively. (See <a href="#fig21">pictures 9 and 10</a>.)</p>
<p>The blast and the thermal pulse were over. But the Air
Force men stood their ground. One question still remained:
Would there be any fallout? They checked their radiation
instruments and waited while the cloud drifted slowly away.
There was no significant rise in the radiation level. The test
had been a complete success. The effects of the explosion
were utterly insignificant on the ground. But high in the
air an enemy plane could have been demolished even if the
nuclear explosion had missed it by a considerable distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>In order that nuclear weapons should be effective against
armed invaders, it is clear that great numbers of these weapons
are needed. Such great numbers of weapons, some of
which must be ground-burst, will produce a considerable
amount of radioactive contamination, and this contamination
will endanger friend and foe alike. In particular, the radioactivity
is likely to kill people in the very country whose liberty
we are trying to defend. For this reason it is most important
that we should be able to use nuclear weapons which
cause the least possible contamination. In recent nuclear tests
more and more attention has been paid to the development of
such clean weapons, and most fortunately these efforts are
well on the way toward success.</p>
<p>The radioactive fallout from nuclear testing gives rise to
a possible danger which is quite limited in size. The danger
from the fallout in a nuclear war, however, would be real
and great. If we stop testing now, and if we should fail to
develop to the fullest possible extent these clean weapons, we
should unnecessarily kill a great number of noncombatants.
Not to develop the explosives with the smallest radioactive
fallout would, indeed, be completely inexcusable.</p>
<p>The only alternative is that nuclear weapons should not be
used at all. Since these weapons have been presented as purely
evil instruments, most people hope that they will never be
used, and indeed one should hope that wars, and therefore the
use of these weapons, can be avoided.</p>
<p>But in our conflict with the powerful communistic countries
which strive for world domination, it may be too much
to hope for uninterrupted peace. If we abandon our light
and mobile weapons, we shall enable the Red bloc to take
over one country after another, close to their borders, as
opportunities arise. The free nations cannot maintain the
massive armies throughout the world which would be required
to resist such piecemeal aggression. On the other hand,
the flexible power of clean nuclear explosives would put us
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
in a position where we could resist aggression in any part of
the world, practically at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>
<p>The announced policy of our country is to maintain peace
and stability in the world. By being patient and prepared we
are trying to arrive at a world order based on law and justice
for all peoples. There is no doubt that this policy is supported
by the overwhelming majority of Americans. Our armed
forces need the greatest possible flexibility in order to give
strength to this policy. Such flexibility we can possess only if
we have in our possession the strongest, best developed weapons
which are also the cleanest, so that they may be used
for defense rather than for random destruction.</p>
<p>If we renounce nuclear weapons, we open the door to aggression.
If we fail to develop clean explosives, we expose
people to disaster from radioactive fallout in any serious military
conflict. To our way of thinking these are weighty arguments
in favor of continued experimentation and development
of nuclear weapons. But still another, more general,
point of view should be considered.</p>
<p>The spectacular developments of the last centuries, in
science, in technology, and in our everyday life, have been
based on one important premise: to explore fearlessly any
consequences to which greater knowledge and improved skills
can lead us. When we talk about nuclear tests, we have in
mind not only military preparedness but also the execution
of experiments which will give us more insight and more
ability to control the forces of nature. There are many specific
political and military reasons why such experiments
should not be abandoned. There also exists this very general
reason&mdash;the tradition of exploring the unknown. We can
follow this tradition, and we can at the same time be increasingly
careful that radioactivity, carelessly dispersed, should
not interfere with human life.</p>

<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />Has Something Happened to the Weather?</h2>
<p>The weather is no longer quite as unpredictable
as it used to be. Yet we are hardly ever sure of it even
a few hours in advance. One week is about the limit of the
period of any prediction. Where the best men lack knowledge
untrammeled fantasy has a field day. Weather has so
far remained a safe topic of conversation and of speculation.</p>
<p>Nuclear explosions have, of course, been made responsible
for the weather&mdash;for any kind of unusual weather. Be it rain
or drought or a hard season of hurricanes&mdash;the nuclear tests
are dragged in. The weather bureau says: no. But then&mdash;the
weather bureau has not always been correct. Indeed it would
be a miracle if the popular talk and the popular press would
not have seen some connection between atomic explosions
and the wayward behavior of the seasons.</p>
<p>In one case&mdash;and to our knowledge only in one case&mdash;there
has occurred a chain of events starting with a nuclear
test and ending in a copious and unusual downpour. In the
spring of 1955 a test shot of moderate size was fired in Nevada.
At the same time the last storm of the season was blowing itself
out in California. According to the usual rules of meteorology
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
the radioactive cloud should have been carried east
by the steady westerly winds which blow over the temperate
zone. But this time the cloud was caught up by the swirl of
the dying California storm and some of the radioactivity was
carried to the west coast.</p>
<p>Hours after the explosion radioactive rain began to fall in
California. The activity was weak enough and did not give
rise to any worry. But a remarkable thing happened. As the
active cloud arrived over California the storm revived. It
developed into an abundant rain which is not usual at that
place and time. Did we&mdash;quite unintentionally&mdash;do something
about the weather?</p>
<p>The weather bureau said: no. One must certainly admit
that this single case proves nothing. Only greatly improved
methods of weather observation and weather prediction
would make it possible to decide if such a chain of events
consists of the strong links of cause and effect or else of a
simple sequence of haphazard occurrences.</p>
<p>Even though our knowledge is incomplete there is at least
one simple fact which should be borne in mind. All the energy
in that Nevada explosion was not quite sufficient to
evaporate the water droplets in a cloud one mile broad, one
mile wide, and one mile deep. This is not a very big rain
cloud. Such a cloud would give about one third of an inch
of rain water over one square mile&mdash;not an impressive
amount. Even the biggest hydrogen bomb would give only
energy enough to evaporate a cloud ten miles by ten miles
and towering to the top of the &ldquo;boiling&rdquo; portion of our air,
which we call the troposphere. This would give roughly three
inches of rain over a hundred square miles&mdash;a more impressive
amount but vanishing in the vastness of the Pacific
Ocean.</p>
<p>Nuclear explosions are violent enough. But compared to
the forces of nature&mdash;compared even with the daily release
of energy from not particularly stormy weather&mdash;all our
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
bombs are puny. Offhand one might guess that our nuclear
fireworks could not swing the scales in the massive energy
changes that we see around us in the common occurrences of
wind and rain.</p>
<p>But the interplay of clouds and sunshine, of water evaporating,
freezing, dropping and thawing&mdash;in short the vagaries
of weather&mdash;are both involved and tricky. Small causes
can give rise to big effects. Some processes of air masses sweeping
over oceans and continents are irresistible and predictable.
Others, like the first upsurge of hot air from the overheated
ground, may be a question of close competition and
trigger action. This is what makes it so difficult to predict the
weather.</p>
<p>One of the most delicate processes we must think about is
the formation of water droplets. When some water molecules
are mixed with air molecules, we have moist air. If such air
rises, expands and cools, the water molecules lose some of
their agitated motion and have a greater tendency to stick
together to form droplets. But it is not easy to get them
started on this joint enterprise.</p>
<p>If two or three molecules stick together, they soon are
shaken apart. If, however, two or three dozen are collected,
this is enough to start a growth which ends in a droplet of
water. If moist air is cooled, droplets will form, provided
there is a meeting place from which the growth can start. If
there is no such meeting place, there are no droplets and we
get no cloud. If there are few meeting places, each will collect
a rather great amount of water, we will get big drops,
and we may get rain. If there is an abundance of meeting
places many tiny droplets are formed which will remain suspended
as a cloud. The present attempts at rain-making are
connected with a birth-control of droplets.</p>
<p>We have seen earlier that in each radioactive decay charged
particles are emitted. As these move along their paths, they
tear up more atoms and leave in their wake an assembly of
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
charged particles. These charged particles strongly attract the
molecules of water. They attract the molecules of air much
less. The reason is that in a water molecule positive and negative
charges are separated to a considerable extent whereas
in the nitrogen and oxygen molecules of air the charges are
distributed more evenly. As a result the track of each particle
emitted in a radioactive decay provides many meeting places
for the formation of water droplets.</p>
<p>Actually, cooled moist air has been used for many decades
to make the tracks of fast charged particles visible. In one
of the photographs you can see a <a href="#fig23">picture</a> of such &ldquo;vapor
trails.&rdquo; It is a photograph through an apparatus called the
Wilson Cloud Chamber. The myriads of radioactive disintegrations
in the debris of a nuclear explosion can give vapor
trails which coalesce into a real cloud. In this way weather
might be influenced. (See <a href="#fig23">pictures 11 and 12</a>.)</p>
<p>In spite of all this it remains highly probable that testing
of nuclear explosions, as practiced at present, does not influence
the weather. Radioactivity does furnish an opportunity
for droplets to form. But other abundant sources are also
available for droplet formation. Dust, smoke and many forms
of air pollution will do the trick. Foam scattered from ocean
waves evaporates and leaves a speck of salt behind. This particle
of salt may be carried by the winds for many miles and
may eventually become the germ around which a new drop
will condense. The cosmic rays by which we are bombarded
give rise to vapor trails similar to those produced by the
radioactive decay products. Among the many processes of
nature and the usual by-products of civilization the few
atomic tests do not play an important role. This statement
can stand, not as a certainty, but as a very good guess.</p>
<p>Among the many surprises that the future holds one may
be closely connected with the weather. In the age of the airplane
we are getting more and more information about the
air masses around us. Air travel demands this information
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
and also furnishes it. New techniques, such as radar, can detect
the formation of a cloud and can measure the size of
droplets at a great distance. In fact the information received
is so plentiful that one may doubt whether we can properly
understand it and utilize it.</p>
<p>Fortunately we no longer need to rely exclusively on our
own brains. Human thought is a remarkable thing but it is
slow. The modern computing machines, the &ldquo;electronic
brains,&rdquo; are simpletons as compared to the apparatus which
each of us wears in his skull. But the electronic computers
have one advantage: they are fast. Soon they will be a million
times as fast as our mental processes. The expression &ldquo;fast as
thought&rdquo; is dated&mdash;it is a contemporary of the horse-and-buggy.</p>
<p>The electronic machines can digest weather information
as fast as it is received. Some progress has already been made.
In a few years all weather predictions may be machine-made.</p>
<p>This need not mean that weather can be predicted with
certainty or for a long time ahead. The trigger processes
which, starting from an insignificant and unnoticed spot of
turbulence, can grow into the dimensions of a cyclone will
set a limit to any art of prediction.</p>
<p>But to the extent that weather cannot be predicted it may
be influenced. If small causes may have big effects then even
the puny means available to man may change the weather&mdash;provided
we know how and where to apply the lever.</p>
<p>First we shall have to acquire a better understanding of
the weather-science of meteorology. Then we shall have to
look for the appropriate trigger mechanism. This may be a
cloud of dust of the right kind&mdash;or else a chemical&mdash;or perhaps
a great number of radioactive particles. In one way or
another atomic explosions may be used as the trigger but the
trigger will not be effective until and unless the rest of the
machinery is understood.</p>
<p>Of course atomic explosions cannot be used in really significant
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
numbers unless we learn how to avoid those radioactive
by-products which are really dangerous. Fortunately
the use of nuclear fusion, best known from the hydrogen
bomb, makes it possible to regulate the kind of radioactivity
one obtains. We may make only such kinds of activity which
decay before they have a chance to get into the human body.</p>
<p>Experience has proved that to talk about weather is not
dangerous. To do something about the weather will be more
risky. Shall the weather become a ward of the government?
Shall we have Republican Rainstorms and Democratic
Droughts? In this way we shall certainly lose the last safe
topic of conversation.</p>
<p>In the narrower confines of Europe where sovereign nation
is a few hours from sovereign nation (as the wind blows) the
situation will be much more serious. But even the whole
planet may prove too small for fiercely conflicting interests
when more knowing fingers are placed on more sensitive
triggers.</p>
<p>To govern the weather can be most useful. It could give
ample livelihood to all the people of the earth and to many
more billions. Such endeavor is surely good and it would
appear peaceful. But in this case as in many other cases
knowledge will lead to power and power will lead to disaster
if it is not tempered by wisdom.</p>
<p>Yet this knowledge or some similarly dangerous knowledge
will come to us in our lifetimes. Nuclear explosions do not
stand alone as a potential source of mischief.</p>

<br />Safety of Nuclear Reactors</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the scientific and industrial
revolution two old ambitions were found to be impossible
dreams. One was the transmutation of elements, the
other the machine of perpetual motion.</p>
<p>Modern nuclear physicists had to retract one of these statements:
elements can be transmuted. But the product is expensive,
for the time being much more expensive than gold.</p>
<p>The perpetual motion machine remains impossible in
principle but the problem may be considered solved in practice.
It can be proved, of course, that a machine can do useful
work only if it burns up some fuel. But the price of fuel is
quite often less than the cost to operate and maintain the
machine.</p>
<p>Nuclear fuel even today is no more expensive than conventional
fuel in many parts of the United States. Nuclear
fuel is neither heavy nor bulky and can be therefore transported
easily. In those parts of the world where ordinary fuel
is expensive, nuclear energy will soon become of great importance.
Furthermore, we shall learn to use most of the
energy in uranium rather than just the part contained in its
rare and valuable isotope, U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>One only has to add a neutron to common U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312; to get
radioactive U&sup2;&sup3;&#8313;. In the course of time this decays into plutonium.
This element can be used like U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309;: It produces fission,
a great amount of energy and enough neutrons to keep
the process going. We shall also learn to extract energy from
other nuclear fuels. Thorium acts like uranium, while deuterium
can give energy by building up bigger nuclei rather
than breaking them into smaller pieces. Therefore the source
of energy will be universally available and quite inexpensive.
This really means that we are as well off as though we had a
machine of perpetual motion.</p>
<p>But, of course, all this does not mean that the machine will
do its job free of charge. Even a perpetual motion machine
would need servicing and maintenance. Unfortunately our
nuclear machines need a lot of such servicing and therefore
for the time being, nuclear energy is not the cheapest.</p>
<p>The main reason why a nuclear energy source, or a nuclear
reactor is difficult and expensive to run is that the reactor
after a short time of operation becomes strongly radioactive.
Therefore it cannot be approached and it has to be handled
by remote control. We can hardly expect that energy will be
free like air or water. But when we learn how to handle
inexpensively our nuclear machines, we shall be able to obtain
energy for a reasonable price at any place on the earth.
Sooner or later conventional fuel will become scarce. But
nuclear energy will allow the industrial revolution to continue
and to expand into every corner of the earth.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that during the next decades nuclear
reactors will greatly multiply and by the beginning of
the next century they will be found everywhere. It is therefore
of the greatest importance that these reactors should be
operated safely. On the face of it, a nuclear reactor is a sluggish
instrument which can be made to run itself. But the
ease of operation is deceptive. (See <a href="#fig25">picture 13</a>.)</p>
<p>One need not fear that a nuclear reactor might explode
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
like an atomic bomb. Nuclear explosives are very carefully
constructed so that they can release a lot of energy in a short
time. Nuclear reactors on the other hand are put together
so as to make it possible that energy will be released only at
a moderate rate. Some reactors if improperly handled may
explode, but the violence of the explosion cannot greatly
exceed that of a similar weight of high explosive.</p>
<p>Nevertheless a reactor accident could become exceedingly
dangerous. The reactor is charged with radioactive fission
products and some other radioactive substances produced by
neutron absorption. Any accident which will allow even a
portion of these products to escape into the air will endanger
people at a considerable distance in the downwind direction.
One reason why reactors can be dangerous is that in protracted
operation of the reactor, fission products which have
longer lives accumulate. It is precisely these longer-lived products
which are more dangerous because they have a better
chance to find their way into the human body.</p>
<p>Reactors are now planned which will produce 300,000 kilowatts
of electricity. If such a reactor operates for half a year
and then explodes and releases its radioactive content into
the atmosphere, its radioactivity will be comparable to that
of a hydrogen bomb. In one important respect such an accident
would be worse than a hydrogen explosion. The nuclear
explosive lifts most of its radioactive products to a high altitude
and the poisonous activity gets dispersed and diluted
before it descends. The activity from a reactor on the other
hand will remain close to the ground and might endanger the
lives of the people in an area of hundreds of square miles.
It will contaminate an even greater territory.</p>
<p>In the extensive operation of many reactors in the United
States no one has yet been killed by the radioactivity. This
has been due to extremely careful operation and also to good
luck. We must be prepared that sooner or later accidents will
occur. On the other hand we must try to take sufficient precautions
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
to avoid the kind of catastrophic accident which we
have mentioned above. With great care such accidents can
indeed be avoided.</p>
<p>In thinking of all kinds of man-made machines we find
some which move fast and seem dangerous like, for instance,
airplanes; others which are stationary and apparently harmless,
like the bath tub. Yet more accidents happen in bath
tubs than in air travel. The most dangerous element in all
operations is the human element. We ourselves constitute the
greatest safety hazard. This is a situation no different in nuclear
technology than in any other kind of technology. What
is new in nuclear technology is that a reactor is usually very
safe but may become extremely dangerous when something
unexpected happens to it. Also we dare not use the method
of trial and error. An error in the reactor business could exact
a far heavier toll of lives than an error in the testing of H-bombs.
We cannot wait to learn by experience; we must forestall
accidents.</p>
<p>An especially difficult safety problem is connected with the
use of reactors in small countries. A serious accident could
endanger the lives of people in adjacent countries. Thus modern
technology may force cooperation across national boundaries.</p>
<p>There is only one way to avoid traffic accidents and that is
care exercised by everyone, particularly the drivers. Similarly
reactor safety will depend on the people who operate the
reactors. At the same time a lot of help can be obtained by
careful construction and scrutiny of each new reactor.</p>
<p>One of the first acts of the Atomic Energy Commission was
to establish a Committee for Reactor Safeguards. With the
passing of years this committee had to take on more heavy
responsibilities. At first it had to operate under secrecy. With
the wider and more public use of reactors the safety considerations
are becoming more available to the public. The
question of safe operation of a machine cannot be separated
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
from a thorough understanding of the working of the machine.
We cannot attempt to give an adequate description of
a reactor or of the safety rules. A few general statements have
to suffice.</p>
<p>A working reactor is full of neutrons. In a small fraction of
a second these neutrons produce fission and a new generation
of neutrons comes into being. In slow reactors which contain
lots of light elements like hydrogen or carbon, the neutrons
move with speeds little greater than that of sound and a generation
may last as long as a millisecond (one thousandth of a
second). In fast reactors which contain almost exclusively
heavier elements like uranium or iron, neutrons move with
a great speed which is about three per cent of the speed of
light. In this case one generation replaces another in less than
a microsecond (one millionth of a second).</p>
<p>Fortunately not all the neutrons get reproduced so rapidly.
Some fissions produce delayed neutrons which are emitted
usually with a delay of several seconds. In a steadily working
reactor each generation should have the same number of
neutrons as the previous one. If each succeeding generation
has even a slight surplus, the reactor will become hot and
may explode in a small fraction of a second. The main reason
why safe operation is possible is the fact that fast multiplication
can occur only if each generation becomes more populous
<i>even when one does not count the delayed neutrons</i>. A
slightly overactive reactor is easily governed, but there comes
a point when the dormant dragon begins to stir. This happens
when there are enough neutrons produced so that multiplication
can occur without waiting for the delayed neutrons.
At that point a well behaved dragon will perform a harmless
action. For instance it may blow a fuse. But a vicious dragon
will spit radioactive fire.</p>
<p>It is not easy to predict whether the dragon will be always
well behaved. But with careful analysis one can make such a
prediction. For instance one must look into the question of
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
whether the reactor is stable. If it gets hotter, does this make
the reactor proceed even faster so that the rate of heating increases
and the reactor runs away? In a stable reactor excess
heat should tend to stop the energy production and thus the
reactor cools and returns to its normal operating temperature.</p>
<p>But too great a stability may also be dangerous. Heating
may be overcompensated by the cooling mechanism; after the
reactor has become too cold it may then heat up too fast and
overshoot again. We must guard not only against a simple
run-away, but also against increasing oscillations.</p>
<p>In many reactors unusual chemical compounds are used. A
reactor accident may start with nothing worse than an ordinary
chemical reaction between strange compounds under
strange conditions. But if this chemical reaction destroys the
reactor sufficiently to allow some fission products to escape,
then such a chemical accident can be as bad as one of nuclear
origin.</p>
<p>In the interior of the reactor materials are exposed to unusually
strong radiation. Under this effect some materials can
change their chemical properties so that what has been inert
as a construction material may become dangerous during the
operation of the reactor.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important single item is the arrangement
of mechanical controls. The reactor is adjusted by a system
of sheets or rods made of a material which absorbs neutrons.
This arrangement must be so constructed that the control
rods can be withdrawn only at a very slow rate. But it must be
possible to put them back quite fast. Any danger signal should
shove the absorbers in at maximum speed. The technical expression
is &ldquo;scram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The main point, however, is that all the dangers and safety
devices can be studied and after careful study a nuclear accident
can be avoided. Some reactors are now so thoroughly
understood that they can be safely used for training of future
nuclear engineers. Other reactors which are more powerful
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
or less well studied have to be used more carefully. Some
reactors should be, and are being, enclosed in gas-tight containers.
If an explosion occurs the fission products will be
harmlessly confined inside the container. Of course, one must
be quite sure that the reactor is of such a type that it cannot
produce an explosion great enough to burst the container
and what is even more important one should be quite sure
that the container is closed except when the reactor is shut
down and completely safe. Often it may be best to build the
reactor underground.</p>
<p>The safety of a reactor, of course, depends to a great extent
on the use to which the reactor is put. In general a power
station is less likely to give trouble than a moving power
source. It is not probable that nuclear locomotives will ever
be safe. In nuclear ships more room is available and more
room permits more safety measures. But even so the safety of
nuclear motors in ships will have to be considered particularly
carefully because ships will have accidents in harbors.</p>
<p>Between the urgent need for progress and the absolute
necessity of safety it is difficult to keep a sense of balance and
one can easily make the mistake of being unnecessarily cautious.
Such unnecessary caution was probably exercised when
the Committee on Reactor Safeguards considered the earthquake
hazard of the Brookhaven reactor on Long Island. A
seismologist, who is a Jesuit Father, was asked to tell the committee<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a>
of the possibilities and probabilities of an earthquake
on Long Island. The chairman<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> of the committee subjected
the expert to a long and detailed questioning. After half an
hour the Committee on Reactor Safeguards ran out of questions.
But the Jesuit Father had not given any signs of running
out of answers. The session being at an end the expert,
looking the chairman of the committee firmly in the eye and
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
in a more authoritative voice than he had yet used, said, &ldquo;Mr.
Chairman, I can assure you on the highest authority that
there will be no major earthquakes on Long Island in the
next fifty years.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />By-products of Nuclear Reactors</h2>
<p>Nuclear reactors generate energy with the
help of nuclear fission. Every time a fission occurs we are left
with radioactive by-products. It is most important to prevent
the uncontrolled escape of these fission products from the reactor.
Fortunately the dangerous products can be retained in
the reactor&mdash;if the machine has been constructed and operated
with reasonable care.</p>
<p>In the end, however, the burnt or partly burnt uranium
charge will have to be removed from the reactor and fresh
charge, fresh fuel will have to be added. What will become
of the fission products at this time?</p>
<p>During protracted operation of a reactor most of the short-lived
fission products decay. Those with longer lives accumulate.
The discharge of the reactor is strongly radioactive,
and it will remain radioactive for many years. One certainly
must not dispose of this radioactive waste in a careless manner.
There are, however, many ways in which one can store
such waste with reasonable safety.</p>
<p>One can deposit the radioactive material in well-built underground
tanks. One can concentrate the activity, imprison
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
it in concrete blocks, and deposit it at the bottom of the
ocean. If one is very much worried he might even put the
radioactivity in rockets and let it decay harmlessly in outer
space. These procedures will cost money and will add to the
expense of nuclear energy.</p>
<p>It would be far better if we could find a way in which the
radioactive by-products could be made to serve a useful and
safe purpose. Some of the by-products can be used and have
been used. These uses are connected with some hazards.
Furthermore, only a small fraction of the fission products
have found good employment up to the present. But the importance
of fission products is growing.</p>
<p>We are using them in research. A radioactive isotope imitates
the behavior of its non-active brother in all chemical
reactions and in all the intricate processes in which matter
changes its form inside a living body. Furthermore a radioactive
substance can be detected with the greatest ease. It can
be found in a concentration which is less than a millionth of
a safe radiation dose. What the microscope has been in the
exploration of the structure of organisms, the radioactive elements
may become in the understanding of the chemical
functioning of living matter.</p>
<p>With better understanding there comes the possibility of
using radioactive by-products for diagnosis. As with the medical
use of X-rays the possible small damage due to radiation
exposure should be regarded as the price for the help we can
get from early and correct recognition of diseases.</p>
<p>In the treatment of patients, particularly in the case of persons
stricken by cancer, radioactive destruction of the diseased
tissue is often preferable to the use of the surgeon&rsquo;s knife.
Such radioactive treatment is new. There is much room for
improvement. Appropriate use of radioactive substances for
this purpose may become a far more powerful tool and much
more widespread than it is at present.</p>
<p>But all these applications will use up only a vanishing
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
fraction of the fission products. Moreover, most of the biologically
important elements are not produced in the fission
of uranium. Many useful activities can be produced by neutron
absorption in reactors. But among the fragments of uranium
perhaps only radio-iodine has been put so far to direct
physiological use.</p>
<p>Industry deals with less sensitive objects than living tissue.
Therefore greater amounts of radioactive materials can be
used here. And indeed radioactivity has done a great variety
of jobs. The penetrating power of X-rays has been used to
control the thickness of sheets in an easy and automatic manner.
Radioactivity has been incorporated into surfaces which
are exposed to mechanical wear or corrosion, to check the rate
at which the surface is worn away by the appearance of activity
in the lubricant or other fluids which have been in contact
with the surface.</p>
<p>By such methods industry has accumulated savings which
are rapidly approaching the billion dollar mark. These savings
will increase as people learn how to use the new materials.
But in all these cases it is important to make sure that
the activity will not hurt anyone while it is used and after it
has served its purpose.</p>
<p>Possibly the greatest amount of radioactivity will be needed
in food sterilization and preservation. One may incorporate
the activities into rods which will safely retain the materials
but which will allow a considerable fraction of the penetrating
gamma rays to escape.</p>
<p>To sterilize food means to destroy all microorganisms.
Many of these are radiation-resistant and may have to be exposed
to 50,000 or more roentgens&mdash;that is one hundred times
as much as would kill a mammal.<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> Such massive irradiation
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
begins to affect the foodstuff itself. In some cases sterilization
by irradiation changes the food more than would be the case
by boiling it or freezing it. In other cases irradiation produces
less undesirable side effects than any other methods.</p>
<p>Another way to use radiation is the preservation of agricultural
products. This need not be done by the difficult procedure
of sterilization. It is enough to control pests and to
prevent germination of the seeds which one is trying to preserve.
Thus we need here approximately one per cent of the
radiation that would be required for sterilization. By so little
radiation the food is not altered to a noticeable extent. It is
precisely in such processes, where great amounts of materials
will have to be irradiated, that a substantial fraction of the
fission products might find employment.</p>
<p>In all applications care has to be exercised lest radioactive
materials should inadvertently be scattered around. Where
great amounts are needed as in food sterilization and preservation,
caution has to be redoubled. That trouble may arise
has been illustrated by an occurrence in Houston, Texas.</p>
<p>Radioactive iridium&sup1;&#8313;&sup2;, which is a beta and a gamma
emitter, was being used by a certain industrial concern to
take X-ray pictures of metal parts. A shipment of this radioactive
material in the form of powder pellets was being
opened by remote control when compressed gas in the container
exploded and scattered some radioactivity around. The
area was shielded but some of the radioactive dust escaped
to the rest of the building. The two men who were operating
the remote control apparatus became contaminated. They
washed themselves and cleaned up the area but did not report
the incident.</p>
<p>A few weeks later a standard radiation check showed that
the plant was still radioactive. Company officials became
worried and called in experts. At this late stage the plant was
thoroughly decontaminated. The homes of the two men were
also examined and were found to be slightly radioactive. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
men and their families were temporarily moved out while
their homes were being cleaned up. When they returned,
neighbors and friends shunned them. The four year old son
of one of the men lost his playmates. People were afraid to
enter the houses. One of the houses was put up for sale but
no one wanted to buy it.</p>
<p>The fact that the houses had been checked by radiation
meters and found to be clean, and the fact that the half-life
of iridium&sup1;&#8313;&sup2; is only 75 days so that any trace of activity
would disappear in a reasonably short time, did not dispel
people&rsquo;s fears.</p>
<p>It is fortunate that no one was seriously hurt in this incident.
But there is an important lesson we can learn from it:
Ignorance may hurt more than radioactivity. That a house
should lose its value in spite of the fact that its radioactive
contamination has been removed, that a little boy should be
shunned as though radioactivity were infectious like the
plague&mdash;these are examples of suffering caused by one of the
greatest sources of human misery: unreasoning fear.</p>
<p>The greatest potentialities of fission products for the future
might lie in still a different direction. Radioactivity can induce
mutations. To what extent this is a danger we have discussed
in an earlier chapter. In the hands of a breeder who
tries to bring about changes in animals or plants radioactivity
could become exceedingly useful.</p>
<p>Of course it is true that most mutations are harmful. It is
also true that artificial mutations have been produced for
many decades. But now it is possible to place simple and
cheap tools in the hands of many more people. Therefore
the chances will increase to find among the many wrong mutations
the few and decisive changes which lead to improvement.</p>
<p>Do we dare to place dangerous materials in so many hands?
We should not do so without making certain that only competent
and responsible individuals will get radioactive materials.
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
This can be done. Druggists have dispensed poison;
doctors and biologists have bred in their laboratories the
multiplying menace of germs. All this was done and is being
done with safety and to the great benefit of all people.</p>
<p>The use of radioactivity should be even more safe because
this material is easy to detect. If poisons or germs become
lost, they may be hard to find. Radioactive materials, however,
give unmistakable evidence of their presence. It is, of
course, never easy to find a needle in a haystack. But the
chance to find it is much better if it is a radioactive needle.</p>
<p>Radioactive by-products need not remain what they seem
to be today: dirt and danger to be disposed of and hidden.
But in the immediate future we shall incur some expense to
keep radioactivity in a safe place.</p>
<p>Some gaseous by-products like the long-lived krypton&#8312;&#8309;
(half-life: 10.4 years) might continue to give rise to real difficulties
and to considerable expense. The trouble is, of
course, that a noble gas like krypton will not be bound to
any material by strong bonds. It may be inadvisable to let
long-lived gases escape. On the other hand, their adsorption
or their storage at low temperature or high pressure may
prove to cost a considerable amount of money.</p>
<p>We have been talking about the problem of handling the
by-products of nuclear power. This problem will not appear
in proper proportion unless we also give some thought to the
by-products of the kind of power we are using at present.</p>
<p>That we do not like smoke and smog is obvious. To what
extent these residues of incomplete burning can cause cancer
or other damage we do not know. Chemistry is more tricky
than radiation. Our lack of knowledge about the slow biological
effects of chemicals is much greater than our remaining
uncertainties about radiation.</p>
<p>In addition to the obvious annoyance and worry caused by
the products of incomplete combustion there exists an interesting
question connected with the result of complete combustion.
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
The carbon that has been deposited through the
geologic ages as coal and as oil is being used up gradually
and converted to a colorless, odorless, harmless gas&mdash;carbon
dioxide. There is always some carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.
The amount is approximately 300 parts per million
of common air. All the carbon that has been burned since
the beginning of the industrial revolution could have increased
the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by ten per
cent to the value of 330 parts per million.</p>
<p>This increase could be significant. Carbon dioxide acts
like a blanket or a valve for some kinds of radiation. In the
daytime we receive energy in the form of visible light from
the sun. This form of radiation has no difficulty in penetrating
the carbon dioxide gas. However, the incoming radiation
is balanced by invisible heat radiation, which flows out
from the earth into space day and night. This infrared radiation
is quite similar in nature to light, only our eyes are
not sensitive to it. Now the carbon dioxide gas acts like a
barrier, though only a partially effective barrier, to this outgoing
heat radiation. If the carbon dioxide content of our
atmosphere were to increase too greatly, it would act like the
glass in a greenhouse and our climate would grow warmer.</p>
<p>A ten per cent increase in the carbon dioxide content of
the atmosphere should have produced an observable rise in
temperature. Such a temperature rise has not, in fact, been
observed. The reason is that not all the carbon dioxide which
has been generated in the processes of combustion has actually
remained in the atmosphere. Most of it has found its way
into the great reservoir of our oceans. Some of it is deposited
as lime at the bottom of the oceans. However, some time is
required for the carbon dioxide to be removed from the atmosphere
and to reach the oceans. One would expect, therefore,
that there would have been at least a slight increase in
the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere. Measurements
show that this is the case and that the increase is about two
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
per cent&mdash;which is too small to have changed our climate.</p>
<p>If we continue to consume fuel at an increasing rate, however,
it appears probable that the carbon dioxide content of
the atmosphere will become high enough to raise the average
temperature of the earth by a few degrees. If this were to
happen, the ice caps would melt and the general level of the
oceans would rise. Coastal cities like New York and Seattle
might be inundated.</p>
<p>Thus the industrial revolution using ordinary chemical
fuel could be forced to end before the advantages of civilization
have spread all over the earth. However, it might still
be possible to use nuclear fuel. With nuclear fuel the industrial
revolution and its countless benefits for man could
continue to every part of the globe. The by-products of the
nuclear age are less bulky and therefore are more easily
handled than the by-products of our coal- and oil-economy.
The main advantage of nuclear energy may yet turn out to
be this: With proper care nuclear energy may turn out to be
the cleanest among the available sources of power.</p>

<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br />The Nuclear Age</h2>
<p>The future depends on people. People are unpredictable.
Therefore, the future is unpredictable. However,
some general conditions of mankind depend on things
like the development of technology, the control won by man
over nature and the limitations of natural resources. These
can be predicted with a little greater confidence. The future
is unknown but in some respects its general outline can be
guessed.</p>
<p>Such guesses are important. They influence our present
outlook and our present actions.</p>
<p>The nuclear age has not yet started. Our sources of energy
are not yet nuclear sources. Even in the military field, where
development has been most rapid, the structure of the armed
forces has not yet adjusted itself to the facts of the nuclear
age in a realistic manner. In politics the atomic nucleus has
entered as a promise and as a menace&mdash;not as a fact on which
we can build and with which we can reckon.</p>
<p>Some technical predictions seem safe:</p>
<p>Nuclear energy will not render our older power plants
obsolete in the near future. But nuclear energy will make it
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
possible to maintain the pace&mdash;even the acceleration&mdash;of the
industrial revolution. It will be possible to produce all the
energy we need at a moderate cost. Furthermore&mdash;and this is
the important point&mdash;this energy will be available at any
place on the globe at a cost which is fairly uniform. The
greater the need for power, the sooner will it be feasible to
satisfy the need with the help of nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>Nuclear energy can be made available at the most outlandish
places. It can be used on the Antarctic continent. It
can be made to work on the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>The expanding front of industrialization has been called
the &ldquo;revolution of rising expectations.&rdquo; That nuclear energy
should be involved in the current and in the turbulence of
this expanding front, is inevitable.</p>
<p>One can say a little more about the effects of scientific and
technological discoveries on the relations among the people
of the globe. With added discoveries raw materials will no
longer be needed with the old urgency. For most substances
substitutes are being found. This may make for greater economic
independence.</p>
<p>On the other hand, new possibilities will present themselves.
We shall learn how to control the air and how to cultivate
the oceans. This will call for cooperation and more interdependence.</p>
<p>The dangers from radioactive by-products will act in a
similar direction. The radioactive cloud released from a reactor
accident may be more dangerous than a nuclear explosion.
Such a cloud will not stop at national boundaries. Some
proper form of international responsibility will have to be
developed.</p>
<p>What effect the existence of nuclear weapons will have
upon the coexistence of nations is a question less understood
and less explored than any other affecting our future. Most
people turn away from it with a feeling of terror. It is not
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
easy to look at the question with calm reason and with little
emotion.</p>
<p>A few predictions seem disturbing but are highly probable:</p>
<p>Nuclear secrets will not keep. Knowledge of nuclear weapons
will spread among nations&mdash;at least as long as independent
nations exist.</p>
<p>Prohibition will not work. Laws or agreements which start
with the word &ldquo;don&rsquo;t&rdquo; can be broken and will always be
broken. If there is hope, it must lie in the direction of agreements
which start with the word &ldquo;do.&rdquo; The idea of &ldquo;Atoms
for Peace&rdquo; succeeded because it resulted in concrete action.</p>
<p>An all-out nuclear war between the major powers could occur
but we may have good hope that it will not occur if we
remain prepared to strike back. No one will want to provoke
the devastation of his own country.</p>
<p>Atomic bombs may be used against cities. But there will be
no military advantage in destroying cities. In a short and
highly mobile war neither centers of supply and communication
nor massive means of production will count. If cities
are bombed, this will be done primarily for reasons of psychological
warfare. We must be and we are prepared for this
kind of war but only as a measure of retaliation. There is
good reason to believe that as long as we are prepared for all-out
war, our civilian population will not suffer from a nuclear
attack.</p>
<p>The certainty of a counterblow gives real protection against
all-out war. No such protection exists against wars limited in
territory and in aims. In the history of mankind such wars
have been most frequent. There is no indication that these
limited wars have ended. We must be prepared for these conflicts
with effective and mobile units, and this requires the use
of nuclear firepower.</p>
<p>Nuclear weapons will certainly have a profound effect
upon such limited warfare. Not all of this effect need be and
indeed it must not be in the direction of greater devastation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>In a nuclear war it will not make sense to use massed manpower.
Any such concentration will provide too good a target
for atomic weapons. To use big, costly and conspicuous machines
of war will be unwise. Such machines will be defeated
by nuclear explosions in the same way as the mailed knight
went down before firearms.</p>
<p>Any fighting unit in a nuclear war will have to be small,
mobile, inconspicuous and capable of independent action.
Such units whether on sea, land or in the air cannot rely and
will not rely on fixed lines of supply. There will be no possibility
and no need to occupy territory and to fight at fixed and
definite fronts. If a war should be fought for military reasons
and for military advantage, it will consist of short and sharp
local engagements involving skill and advanced techniques
and not involving masses that slaughter and are being
slaughtered.</p>
<p>If an invader adopts extreme dispersion, it will become impossible
to defeat him with atomic weapons. But a very highly
dispersed army can be defeated by a determined local population.
Therefore the main role of nuclear weapons might
well be to disperse any striking force so that the resistance
of people defending their homes can become decisive. Nuclear
weapons may well become the answer to massed armies
and may put back the power into the hands where we believe
it belongs: the hands of the people.</p>
<p>At this point we are brought back to the main topic of this
book: radioactivity. In a limited nuclear war the radioactive
fallout will probably kill many of the innocent bystanders.
We have seen that the testing program gives rise to a danger
which is much smaller than many risks which we take in our
stride without any worry. In a nuclear war, even in a limited
one, the situation will probably be quite different. That noncombatants
suffer in wars is not new. In a nuclear war, this
suffering may well be increased further due to the radioactive
poisons which kill friend and foe, soldier and civilian alike.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Fortunately there exists a way out. Our early nuclear explosives
have used fission. In the fission process a great array
of radioactive products are formed, some of them intensely
poisonous. More recently we have learned how to produce
energy by fusion. Fusion produces fewer and very much less
dangerous radioactivities. Actually the neutrons which are a
by-product of the fusion reaction may be absorbed in almost
any material and may again produce an assortment of radioactive
nuclei. However, by placing only certain materials near
the thermonuclear explosion, one may obtain a weapon in
which the radioactivity is harmless. Thus the possibility of
clean nuclear explosions lies before us.</p>
<p>Clean, flexible and easily delivered weapons of all sizes
would make it possible to use these bombs as we want to use
them: as tools of defense. When stopping an aggressor we
would not let loose great quantities of radioactive atoms
which would spread death where we wanted to defend freedom.
Clean nuclear weapons would be the same as conveniently
packaged high explosives. They would be nothing
more.</p>
<p>The possibility of clean explosions opens up another development:
the use of nuclear explosives for the purposes of
peace. Conventional high explosives have been used in peace
fully as much as in war. From mining to the building of dams
there is a great variety of important jobs that dynamite has
performed. Nuclear explosives have not been used in a similar
way. The reason is the danger from radioactivity. Once
we fully master the art of clean explosions peaceful applications
will follow and another step will be made in controlling
the forces of nature.</p>
<p>All this is of course only a small part in the process of the
increasing power of man and the increasing responsibility of
man. As the impossible of yesterday becomes the accomplished
fact of today we have to be more and more aware of
our neighbors on this shrinking planet. The arts of peace may
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
lead to conflicting interest as easily as they may lead to fruitful
cooperation. If we ever learn to control the climate of the
world, a nation may find itself in the same relation to another
nation as two farmers who have to use the waters of the same
river.</p>
<p>Rivals are men who fight over the control of a river. When
the same word &ldquo;rivals&rdquo; comes to mean cooperation for the
best common use of the river or any other resource&mdash;that will
be the time of law and of peace. Surely this sounds like
Utopia and no one sees the way. But the general direction in
which we should go is not to consider atomic explosives and
radioactivity as the inventions of the devil. On the contrary,
we must more fully explore all the consequences and possibilities
that lie in nature, even when these possibilities seem
frightening at first. In the end this is the way toward a better
life. It may sound unusually optimistic in the atomic age,
but we believe that the human race is tough and in the long
run the human race is reasonable.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
